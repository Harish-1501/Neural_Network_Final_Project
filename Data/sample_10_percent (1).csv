Ri7NV5YV0r4,Top 5 Best Selling Gaming Mice  - Are they Actually GOOD?,"The best selling gaming mice right now are pretty surprising since I expected something a LOT different.  But at the same time, some of these shouldn't be passed over because they are the most popular gaming mice.  Rather, some of these are some of the best mice of all time while others are....not so great.

#bestgamingmiceamazon2021 #bestgamingmice2021 #hardwarecanucks",gaming,463349.0,12042.0,663,PT10M55S,"I'm torn between buying a Logitech G502 HERO for $38 or a Razer Orochi V2 for $44, both are on sale and I can't decide which is better, any recommendations? ||| I like G502 x wired version. It be be looking better with RGB lighting how X Plus Wireless has with the Logitech G logo colored to be exactly alike G502 Hero. ||| Kind of curious how well the Razer basilisk v3 holds ||| I don't like the Ghub software though.  Compared to the older Logitech Gaming software.  The hub is slow, and shyite ||| Thanks so much for this video! Getting ready to replace a mouse with dying left click, and after watching several videos and reading several reviews, I'll be getting the Hero (which is still available and currently on sale through Logitech.) Looking forward to experiencing infinite spin!😄 ||| Im in the minority that thinks the infinite scroll wheel is bad. 
It makes the stepped scrolling mode super washed out. Its harder to do middle clicks which is a deal breaker because i prefer to hyper scroll with middle mouse. ||| g102? ||| I bought corsair katar pro wireless mouse 6/7 months ago, it is comfortable to use but in heavy use of illustrator or photoshop it lags sometimes.Also the scroll wheel missing its scrolling. 😢 ||| The first mice is like a gt beyblade which is very cool feature to customise the weight of your item with iron armor ||| Clearly the Lenovo office mouse is the best ||| I have a Razer Naga Molten and I'm still using it for 10 freaking years!
Also super confused about what's gonna be my next mouse. Even though Naga Molten is a MMO (had no idea back then lol) mouse, I'm not into MMO and only into FPS gaming. ||| Basilisk V3 is not for Fps gaming..Viper or Deathadder is the best choise. ||| g502 is perfect, but it's wired. got razer basilisk x hyperspeed instead ||| There are so many higher quality mice from Zowie, Lamzu, Pulzar, Endgame Gear, XtrFy or Ninjutso. ||| G502 right top button switch tends to stop working after 2 years. I had two of them and booth stopped almost in the same time. Otherwise no complaints. ||| What would u recommend for a mouse under 10.bucks ||| I guess SteelSeries didnt pay lol ||| Sorry but heavy mice do NOT offer more control lmao ||| My Logitech G305, which, however, doesn't have those 2 rough spots on the main right button, has recently started acting up (left main button is sometimes going crazy when in use), after 4 years of not that frequent, and non-gaming, use. 😢 ||| THIS IS A SCAM AND YOU KNOW IT. YOU KNOW THOSE SCROLLWHEELS ACTUALLY WORK LIKE TRASH WHEN USED ON ACTUAL WEBPAGES/INGAME. STOP LYING. They jump 1 extra click than u want....in EITHER direction. They require u LOCK after u UNLOCK or it will move on its own! Any TAP on the sidebuttons....god willing u can actually reach them on half these products...WILL MOVE THEM. And they have ridiculous TrAVEL TiME to PRESS. ||| I bought the last mouse about three or five years ago without knowing it was for gaming. ||| I actually have the last mouse, but only because I got 2 of them for 1 dollar 😂 ||| i have a viper mini, and it's my favorite mouse ||| The only thing holding the g305 is that AA battery. Logitech should just put an offset triple A instead, shifting the weight to the front. Easily one of the best mouses on the market. ||| i own a logitech G-602 at least 6 yrs now for around $40.      now on amazon they are $ 176  what happened ||| where is RAZER DeathAdder -_- ||| Im so happy I got a viper mini for 20$! ||| Been using that VicTsing mouse for years and it's amazing but it didn't take long for it to suffer from double click after a year or two. Other than that great mouse ||| 5:07 ""A comfortable AMBIDEXTRIOUS, right-hand-only shape"" ...What? ||| Razer DiamondBack Plasma Blue. ||| I recently bought a Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse and found that it sometimes freezes and the index button sometimes take up to three ""hits"" to actually activate... this was my first ""wireless"" mouse... I am returning it and watching videos to see what my next choice may be... it will probably be a wired mouse. ||| i personally like the Glorious model o- wireless because of its smooth lighting and design and it fits my hand perfectly it also is 65 grams!, it is not so expensive like razer or Logitech wireless mice and gmo is not available to be bought in my country so there is no market price so the price of the mouse in my country can vary from 80 dollars (sgd)-128 dollars (sgd) i was lucky and got mine for 80 dollars on Carousell, there are cheaper alternatives and i do not recommend the glorious model o or o- if you are not really into gaming ,there are cheaper alternatives like g304.Afterall it comes down to preference because some might like wired or wireless mouse light or light mouse ||| I only every bought one gaming mouse, a G500 10 years ago. It lasted almost 3 years and when it failed it was still under warranty, so Logitech replaced it with a G502. I'm still using the G502 7 years later even though it has even spent a good bit of time in my backpack, instead of sitting on a desk in ideal conditions. There are a few things that I have observed though.

i) The bottom has a few thin plastic tabs that come loose, so I have to super-glue them from time to time so that they don't stick out and offer a scratching resistance while I move the mouse.
ii) The rubbery material on the sides of the mouse, where your thumb and little finger grip does feel good, but easily gets disgusting and is a pain to clean. At this stage the material by the thumb is worn down enough that I can see the hard plastic underneath.
iii) The G logo that is lit by a blue LED has a greenish tinge. I think that it's because the transparent plastic is dirty, but there is no way to clean it.
iv) Part of the cable popped out of the braided cover in two places very quickly (within months, if that). This also happened with the G500 before and just looks poor aesthetically.


Some of these are just part of general wear because I have owned the mouse for a long time, so I guess that I can't expect them to be addressed. However, the issue with the dirty finger grips and braided cable occurred quickly and would happen well within the warranty of the product, so should be considered. ||| I got a G502 hero some months ago. Apart from the fact it wasn't working in Windows 7 cause it needed the Logitech ""Suite"" to work and it was inompatible with Windows 7... so i had to install to my other pc that runs windows 10 (i have 2 PCs)... well, APART that irritating first surprise... it just stopped working after 4 months in the sense that it's left button was from time to time not registering and needed multiple presses... So terrible quality this G502 Hero... I still got working mouses 15years old of 5 euro... I hadn't unticipated such an excpencive mouse to have all these problems and inconveniences. ||| Razer has quality problems. ||| g305 forever ||| If you have the money go for logitech pro x superlight trust me beats the 502 by miles ||| wanna see ur reaction when im getting Moabs (Nukes) in COD Mw3 with a 1.5$ mouse ..Yes 1 dollars and 50 cents ,, however its sooo frustrating i started to hate playing.. ||| I bought the g 305 and loved it until the thumb buttons stoped working and the mouse was cutting out probably cuz it was wireless but the mouse is really good but only for four months ||| Has anyone noticed my guy was playing roblox 💀 ||| I bought the viper mini in my country here it was selling in 15 dollars mark 50% sale hahaha ||| ZA 11c , everything Else too small For Long Fingers Hands ||| What laptop you using? ||| Tried two Razers. Very low quality materials and wheels started to squeal after 4 months of use.
For me only one brand on this planet exist - Logitech. Now using G502 HERO. Happy AF. ||| no ||| g402 or razer viper mini ||| I really like G502 Hero, but there's a huge problem. Double clicking is real :(. If you really like the ergonomics of g502 Hero and don't care about it being with wire just go for Razer Basilisk V3, same but better + no double clicking issue ||| Nice shirt ||| I got the Victsing mouse and the scroll wheel would work 5% of the time. ||| Whats that shooting baloon game called? ||| Amazon will sell you knock offs, too. So be careful. ||| I had a g502 proteus spectrum where the middle click crapped out after six months, so I opened a case with Logitech and they told me the proteus was discontinued, so they sent me the hero version as a replacement. I’ve had that mouse for four years and it still works. It’s $38 on Amazon right now ||| I just want a mouse with a nice clicky sound :') ||| I love how they call it an ""infinite scroll wheel"" when every scroll wheel is infinite. ||| that first logitech 502 hero with the weights sucks for me in linux mint. it double clicks way too many times. no debouncer or something. using it right now and is the reason i'm watching this video right now. looking for better mouse. it sucks. ||| so annoying, all of them are so fuc*ing small ... its so hard to find a nice mouse after 5 years -,- ||| dont recommend razer viper mini
razer is not known for long lasting products they always last up to maximum 3 years if lucky
razer viper mini can have jumping wheel defect ||| The new viper got leaked.  That's why the sales dropped off. ||| microsoft basic optical mouse is where its at ||| The viper mini on jd which is basically the Amazon of china(that means the main brands like Logitech and razer have official stores on there)is only $15 which is an absolute steal ||| the more and more I watch your reviews the more and more intrigued I am ||| I still use an old g502 I got in like 2015. I really like the shape and how it fills my hand more than other mice so nothing has really made me want to try out something else ||| Where are the time stamps dude?? I came for the g502.. I can't sit through the whole video! And I'm definitely not gonna scroll and find it. Yes I have the time to type this! Get with the change guys. ||| I came here because I am tired of buying gaming mice and wanted recommendations. So far they won't last two years without breaking. My G305 was a terrible disappointment considering its left click support broke and I could not click anymore and that wheel broke off and could not scroll consistently. Then I switched to a famous german mouse, again, made in China, that had the right click issue. No I own a red dragon (it was a gift) and now, after a year, when clicking it clicks double. I am starting to think there is no such thing as a durable mouse anymore. ||| Lol $50 dollars is affordable for a mouth. Gas 9s 4.30 a gallon. ||| Is that star lord? ||| I actually have the last mouse myself, and I'm gonna be honest with you, It's lasted me over a year and I used to take it to school and dropped it a few times, but it works fine, aside from the scroll wheel going up every time I scroll down and vice versa, but it still works fine! ||| Razer mini has worst sensor ever with 3mm lod. Its popular only because its cheap ||| ""a comfortable ambidextrous right hand only shape"" what the fuck are you on about? ||| its good ||| If logitech can make the G502 less close to 90g, then I will buy it ||| I actually still have the braided wire version of the G502. Admitingly, over the years, it did have ""ghost clicks"" but it's nothing a quick fix couldn't help. I just cleaned out the sensitive copper switches with metal polish and they act just as new. ||| I think we will cop a razer viper mini and a g305 wireless thx ||| It's amazing how G502 is the best selling design since its release (2014). The only changes were RGB, Hero sensor and lightspeed wireless (with some weight reduction but the same shape). ||| I've used that PTECk gaming mouse for years, and its just so good. I've never used high end gaming mice before, although i do use a Logitech G203 prodigy now. ||| i bought g102 and i wanna up to GPRO x superlight but is it worth it? ||| The hero 502 is indeed nice. Just a good, reliable workhorse with an amazing scroll wheel. The only gripe I have with it is the lack of a comfortable rest for my pinky. ||| viper mini is #3 coz MINECRAFT PVP ||| Getting g305 was one of the biggest mistake of my life. It has broken 2 times due to double clicking issue (logitech accpets that its their fault and renewed my mause 2 times and each renew took about a month, so yeah I had to buy new mause while waiting for renewing process) its also quite heavy mause compare to g pro. So I kindly advice u to stay away... ||| is Logitech G102 lightsync a good mouse for fps games ? ||| I'm a huge fan of the minimalistic mice. Running the Logitech Superlite and the SteelSeries Rival 3 Wireless. I've always favored SteelSeries, I love the construction and they're just effective at a low cost. Wireless mice are basically rocking with the wired big boys now. ||| when i hear people use mice for years, i don't believe them. Mice don't last 6 month in my hands. The first thing that goes is the scroll. ||| What is that watch you have? ||| My eyes are on 🐁 mouse kept right behind the lappy.
Please name it sir 💙💚. ||| The Logitech G502 Hero is hands down the best mouse I have ever used. ||| I got the g502 for xmas, my parents gave it to me early, I tried it out and absolutely hated it, its too heavy and I pressed the extra side buttons constantly, I have a hyperx pulsefire core which is 96 grams, almost 30 grams lighter than the g502. My parents returned the g502 and got me the razer viper 8k and IM IN LOVE WITH IT, its 25 grams lighter than my previous mouse and 8 times faster due to the optical switch and 8khz hyperpolling and its got 100%  PTFE mouse feet that are a lot like hyperglides and they feel amazing. I STRONGLY recommend it. ||| I've never paid more than $10 for a mouse and never will. ||| i bought a g502 lightspeed and i immediately put all the weights on, cuz i play with very high dpi (2700) and i need high stopping power for a mouse ||| I didn't know Chris Pratt moved over to doing tech videos ||| My razer viper is really pissing me off with intermittent disconnects. ||| his jawline is that of a chads ||| chare your setting of cs:go! ||| Hi! im here to tell you that Jesus Christ loves you and wants you to repent and trust in Him! He gave up His glory and His throne to suffer and die for us, because we’ve all sinned against a holy and perfectly just God, but He gave His only son Jesus for you. Because we’re all heading to hell, because we’ve sinned (lied, stolen, using God’s name as a cussword, dishonoring your parents, making up your own god, adultery etc. Like c’mon you can’t tell me you haven’t lied atleast once in your life). But
John 3:16: for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, so that everyone that believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Yeah you heard that right! God wants to give you everlasting life with Him, but that’s not possible when you’re still living in sin and because of that you’ll spend eternity in hell. That’s why Jesus came! So now all you have to do is repent wholeheartedly of your sins and trust in Jesus! He will give you a new heart with new desires and you will be made new and holy. But we’ll never be perfect on this earth, because we’re still in our earthly body. But we’ll be deattached to our flesh and we’ll have our focus on Jesus and God’s kingdom that’s coming! It’s coming very soon btw so please repent (confess and forsake) of your sins and trust in Jesus that He may change you and make you new and give you everlasting life in Heaven without disease, lain, suffering etc. Instead of hell and hellfire.
So repent and trust in Jesus!! He’s the one that can save you and He loves you so much!! <33 ||| The racer basilisk v2 is just a lighter, and more clean, and just overall less in-your-face version of the g502 ||| I hate mouse that's lighter than 85 gram (cable excluded). Doesn't even feel organic at all. ||| log tech mouse are dogshit u have to disable the ree sensitivity button when playing fps's. I cant tell you how many times ive lost in overwatch because of this stupid mouse changing my dpi ||| No infinite scroll-wheel, no buy. He's right in that it's hard to go back. Unfortunately, I'm looking for a basic/travel wireless mouse right now and the one from this lot that looked interesting lacks that one magical feature. ||| 8:34 meanwhile me gaming with this mouse for about 3 years now. ||| I actually use the G502 SE at work...but my main setup Mouse is a Glorious Model D ||| How come I keep seeing videos about razer and logitech that put mouses out there so expensive I gotta starve to buy one and still be having double click issues (register 1 click as 2). I am using a roccat mouse for 6 years now and it still works and I never had the double click issue with it. How come these companies put mouses 100$ and more with a double click issue lol? To me they are good only for FPS games and thats it. If I get to play something where I have to drag or to single click on a chest to see option and it clicks 2 times it would open the chest to me thats not serious. You literally cannot use them for work either lets say you work on a pc with programs like photoshop and others and the mice double clicks? What do you do then ummmm why did I gave 150$... Yes exactly why? ||| logitech's wires are very stiff compared to razers. plus ALL 4 flagship logitech mice i've owned have double clicked in 1-2 years. i now go Razer Optical Switch mice to avoid this issue. ||| Just bought the g502 yesterday, i can't stop spinning the mouse wheel, so far it's perfect. ||| Nice haircut =) ||| Any recommendations for an alternative to the Logitech G502? No problem with the price but I need as many buttons as the G502 ||| How about the razer double click issue? ||| I Have A RGB mouse For about 8.5$ 
Got it from amazon 
It is programmable 
grippy rubber-like finish 
has 3 buttons on the left side 
customizable 4DPI switch (I set my dpi to what I want and removed that Dpi button to use as Play/pause button)
and the cable is fibre or a cloth-like sleeve material
has a thumb rest 
has a maximum of only 7000DPI
minimum is 200
and the mouse is programmable like we need to do the settings in the app and apply it and it will get stored in the mouse
And it supports Macro which is programmable we can set delay and which button activates it ||| Yo wtf that last mouse is the first mouse my mom bought for me 2 years ago because I just played on ps4.
(I still have it even though it is broken) ||| This list is trash without the G602 ||| 8:55 - The 0.99€ mouse: Hold my beer ||| what is that game ur playing? ||| I picked up the Logitech G703 6 months ago and so far it is my favorite gaming mouse. ||| I have the viper mini, it’s absolutely amazing for people with smaller hands, and the program is amazing for rgb customizing and more! ||| viper mini is the best ||| No love for G102? ||| Im still rockin the G102 until now even if I replaced the left and right click switches as they died too soon.
Random question. What is the standard dimensions of a table for pc? because I have a 60cm by 100cm table and it feels cramped to me... ||| I'm amazed to not see any Bloody nor Glorious mouse here ||| Logitech G502 - Its a fine mouse.. up to a few months in, the left button sometimes becomes stuck and if you play a lot of FPS games the left click wont trigger meaning you wont fire.. Returned my first one and got a 2nd one and a few months later had the same issue.. ||| If you want to buy number five cmon at least at least but the t16 ||| At 00:58, top row, second from the left; the Razor Trinity (looks like my Razor Hex) should be on the list, IMHO.
I use this plus the Razor Nostromo key pad.

I have the keypad set up for movement and the mouse set up for Alt, Shift, Ctrl, Alt-Shift, Alt-Ctrl, and Ctrl-Shift.

So, unmodified, the keypad is 15 key, scroll wheel, 8 way hat, a push button, and a flat button; 15+3+8+1+1=28 x 6 mouse modifiers = 168 programmable combinations.
Drop this by 4 on the hat x 6 = 24, or 144 that I could use.  As it is difficult to get the hat to quickly register north east, instead of just north or just east.

This is great in MMOs that have a slew of powers.  Not sure about FPS, as I don’t care for shooters. ||| the only thing i dislike about the infinte scrollwheel is that most websites use increments scrolling so if you scroll slowly it feels weird ||| Review the g hati ace? ||| i use g502 for 5 years and not gonna change my mouse, it is da best mouse IMO ||| I tried the G502 and it's not really for me. I only bought it because of the good reviews but it left me disappointed. Much like the MX518 way back. Everyone was hyping that mouse but when I tried it, it didn't really fit me all that well. It may not be on the list, but I've had better days using the Deathadder V2 Elite as a daily driver. It just fits my hand perfectly. ||| 2:28 - what mouse is behind notebook? ||| Uhh where is model o (if there is  I’m not that into the video yet’ ||| Had a G502. Left click button broke after 5 months. This seems to be a common problem too the more I read about it.
It's a pretty mice but switches are total garbage... Not worth it. ||| I love my Viper mini, had it for a year and still works perfect ||| The g502 sucks hard, eeeew, i really really dislike this piece of garbage ||| i play games with my touchpad ||| PAid promotion.. rubbish sub ||| Try g1s.  Accurate and light   used for 1 year now and still working.  I bought like 5 to stockpile ||| thumbnail: g502
title: are thy good?
me: how dare you even talk about checking thet quality ||| Anyone thinks its a good idea to get a razer basiliskv2 for 50 euro?
Its on sale in my area ||| to me, the Razer Naga/Naga Trinity is the best mouse of all time, I got a lot of other mice but still, keep going back to it. something in it makes it irreplaceable for me ... ||| i have the 502G, is a great mouse but it have a defect after a few months the right click stop working properly, its a documented issue with that model if your main game isnt a FPS go for it, but if you play a lot of FPS try another that the switchs dont die.

Edit: i contacted logitech for the warranty, they where great for replace it for free. ||| Hi Dimitri. Please review the Gigabyte C700 glass cabinet. ||| No mention of SteelSeries? Personal preference here, but I recently picked up the Aerox 3 and must say, I used to be one that prefers a heavier mouse, but after using it for a while, the lighter mouse is so much better, especially when we use it a lot more often. ||| logitech g400 and 500 are amazing ||| Finally someone who reviews mice and IS CLICKING THE BUTTONS so one can hear how they sound. Thank you for that, kind sir! ||| His face changed ||| As someone woth a shit reaction time and heavy wrist aiming the 502 hero is honestly awesome ||| been using the orignal razer viper and the red dragon impact for mmos both great mice ||| Man.. the quality of this video makes me want to scratch my head a little. Damn awesome lighting and production ||| Zelotes mouses 10/10 not had one been disappointing (had even a vertical one at one point) 
My other recommendation thermaltake talon blu i literally flung it at a wall once and it survived that, now thats quality ||| logitech is CHEAP SHIT dont waste your money on that crap it lasts 3 months and is just crap cheap materials and poor build quality ||| Good video but that creepy thing you kept doing with your hand walking up to the mouse at 1:43 and 9:42 really weirds me out lol ||| Avoid Razor mice. Their scroll wheels get stiff quickly and the left mouse button will start double clicking after a year. ||| I got the Pictek PC278A (#26 @1:00). I use it at 8000dpi, with sensitivity on low in windows, 1000hz polling rate, and it's silky smooth. I don't think I can go back to a mouse without the ring and little finger grooves and thumb rest. I've mapped the dpi buttons to windows volume up and down. It's so good for gaming and browsing. ||| man I'm using a Logitech m720 cuz my dad said it was a ""good gaming mouse"" ||| I loved my g502 but i had to give it up the ghub sucks i constantly have to restart it because it wont load my settings ||| Razer synapse is so bad....I'll never buy another Razer. ||| G502: left button faulty after 20 months. ||| The market changed a lot, you can now find a quite decent PMW 3360 mouse for about 30 bucks, from lesser known brands like SPC Gear or Modecom in Poland. PMW 3360 sensor, omron switches, braided cable and decent quality, for about 30 bucks. Of course memory and rgb :) ||| I'm shocked that the Death Adder V2 Mini wasn't on that list. Its really really good and like $20 right now. ||| I got a Razer Basilisk Ultimate at the end of last month and I LOVE it! ||| So top 3 is great but 4 & 5 is just cheap and usable
Makes sense LOL ||| Minecraft ers be like bad bad bad bad bad no drag very bad ||| why do you look like chris pratt ||| Chris pratt ranking mice ||| LOL ""IT WONT BLOCK YOUR MEMORY THINGS"" 2:58 ||| Was using g402 for years now and now upgraded to g502 lightspeed such an amazing mouse :) ||| im broke....                                                                                                                         but nice video though ||| G502 has betrayed me after 5yrs of use, the left click double clicks sometimes, the programmable wheel left button does not work anymore and the scroll wheel adjusting button gets stuck sometimes, but otherwise its given me solid service. ||| I wonder if Logitech has a patent or something on the infinite scroll wheel as I never see it from other manufacturers ||| Do razer mouse still broken in few months? ||| Never knew that my viper mini was top 3 selling. Thought ppl with small Handy only buy it ||| Why aren't other mice makers cloning the Logitech scroll wheel????  Would love to have one thats an ounce or 2 lighter. ||| Viper Mini, been using it for 8 months, best purchase of my life when it comes to gaming ||| Dmitri got surprised by the cheapness of 8 usd mouse, and some mouse on my office has 2usd mouses ||| I dream of the G502, but it costs half my monthly salary. ||| As a leftie why do we not call out ambidextrous mice that don't have buttons on the right hand side? So annoying. ||| the only time u want the g502 is for productivity but i still would never recommend it for fps games because 1 it is heavy, 2 it is large so bad control and 3 those skates are just POO! how does logitech make good products yet make garbage mice until the g305 and g pro super light. sorry for bei8ng a bit bias but thats my opinion OwO ||| Question,
 for someone with normal sized hands, is the viper mini good or should i go for glorious model O?
I'm currently using Deathadder v2 mini, only problem problem is it's abit small for my hand, Any Tips People? ||| Paid promotion. Oh man so disappointing ||| this guy looks like chris pratt with a small face ||| dOwg WattER ||| I have smaller hands than most people and the razed viper mini is more than perfect and there is absolutely no delay even from the mouse to a usb hub to my laptop to my monitor. Amazing ||| I don't get the hype about the viper mini. The  mouse is so tiny its uncomfortable. I bought the viper ultimate after being disappointed with the mini and its literally so much better than the mini. Also wireless is such a step up from any wired mouse imo. ||| NOTE: Don't buy the Walmart brand ONN! The red LED light that is used to track shoots forward through the spaces in the  scroll button and lights anything in front of you like a wall. It's so annoying. ||| I still dig my Swiftpoint Z mouse. If it had Logitech's lightspeed wireless and the Logitech scrollwheel, it might hit mouse perfection. ||| i use the g305 and the model o-
really like them both but the g305 has a special place in my heart. ||| What they call a ""gaming mouse"" is no different than calling a chair a ""gaming chair"".  You can game on both regardless of what it's called or marketed to. ||| why I only have the g304 ||| Bruh i just realized that the $8 dollar mouse is the one i have 😂😂 Been having for like 2 years though ||| G502 is the goat at this point ||| I'm using the Glorious Model O and I am happy with the sensor but the wheel sucks! the groves are far too big, making me feel like a baby climbing the stairs, and that is when it works because it doesn't always respond on slow rolls. I'd also perfer the clicks to be quieter. If anyone has any advice on other mice let me know. Thanks ||| Could someone please let me know which game he's playing at 2:29 ||| If you need a insane budget gaming mouse I highly recommend the Logitech G102. I got mine for $16 and it's been awesome. ||| i have to say that even the crossair katar pro wireless is good (its like 20 bucks) while being cheap its really good ||| is this worth compare to razer viper mini ||| Hardware Canucks, I challenge you to sleep with the G502 Hero infinite scrool wheel. ||| The Hero suffers from a left mouse button that dies and starts double and triple clicking. I should know I'm on my 4th one. ||| G403 for four years,  best mouse I ever owned.    before I used razer and they are garbage.   razer double clicks and synapse is a disaster.    ask linus about razer quality or lack there of. ||| what laptop u use? ||| Logitech makes great mice. I am glad to see they are selling well. ||| What is that bubble shooting trainer? ||| I'm a competitive CoD player .. my picks: 1. Razer DeathAdder V2, 2. Corsair M65 (QC has been bad lately including scroll wheel and right/left switches), 3. Logitech G502 HERO.

I've just tried about 10 different gaming mice including .. Glorious Model O, Corsair Glaive PRO, Razer Basilisk v2  and many more .. ALL RETURNED! ||| Isnt hardware canucks a blackguy ||| Hard to recommend Logitech Gaming series mice... been having double click issues on 4 of their mice in a row. ||| Great comparison my friend.

I can't believe she got a great interface and a good mic but THOSE MONITORS? ||| Does Jake and Sarah own the same cat 🙀? ||| 7:14 pointing at opposit direction in motherboard cpu socket ||| It's freaky watching this now that Intel have basically given up on existing as a company. ||| at2020 is a fierce mic, been using mine for about 10 years and it still sounds good as hell! ||| yep cant stand her ||| Your film taste is impeccable. I own mountains of A24 merch lol ||| No! by flipping it the correct way up it's now a ""Fixed Ratio"" blanket...I assume this is joke was made before but I still wanted to make it just in case. Secondary joke: Sarah better not let it get stained like her deskpad or it won't be a golden ratio blanket anymore ||| 8/10 video not enough Arlo ||| I know it was a bit, but spending $4,000 of Intel’s money on coffee would be hilarious ||| 4:44
pov: you cosplay as voldemort ||| Im sorry but shes hilarious! xD ||| great stuff ||| l o u d ||| rewatching bc I legitimately adore this setup ||| ARLO THE GOAT 🐐 ||| you should give her more tech tips ||| ""yes, i'll be streaming tonight""
*Last live 3 years ago*
guess she did stream that night and never again... ||| Hmm I feel like I’ve seen that bathroom door before… ||| I know this was 3 years ago but I hope someone told her that essential oils are dangerous for cats. He's such a beautiful creature 😭❤️ ||| Butt lol ||| 8:46  Bit zesty there linus 🤔 ||| Is this js a video of sarah being racist 😭😭😭 ||| Dont say it. Do not do the backdoor joke when hes talking to sarah butt. No he definitely came through the front door. Dont say it bad me ||| years later after watching this. I love how her name is Sarah Butt and linus says we didn't use the front door for obvious reasons. ||| i love how dave is getting so many ass shots, like dave you need to get some couchie ||| you don't need to be nuts to work at LTT ,  but it helps :) ||| 19:15 bro is a veteran Armored Core player ||| 4000 dollars of Starbucks. That should serve you for almost a whole month. ||| arlo ftw ||| i never got stickers when i bought the ltt screwdriver ||| she is so annoying ||| my amd laptop handles minecraft ||| The worst part of the Dino collectable is that I want it too!!! ||| I'm curious as to how dangerous fur is to be around assembled parts? ||| She yells instead of talking O.O ||| Kitty kitty kitty! ||| Top 10 most annoying humans on earth. Linus ix a fekingsaint. ||| $1000 spend on the intro animation 😭🪑 ||| As a bartender, i appreciate the 1800 agave tequila. would say it is my favourite ||| THAT IS SICK 🤣I'll still need to see these first two minutes from time to time 😂😂😅 ||| This women is absolutely stunning,   Linus should swap his wife for her, she is an instant upgrade. ||| Midsomer..... ||| Arlo is an absolute star! ||| if i ever got a chance to do a tech upgrade i’d ask sarah for tips bcus this is so nice omg ||| hilarious this girl wants to hot knife the filter cover ||| The tech tips on theese tech upgrades are sometimes better than actual tutorials, but the same as the RAM being put with stickers towards the CPU from newer tech upgrade, you can just put cpu in socket just by orienting the print on it to readable position in the case. ||| So, so.... if Alinity got cancelled for throwing her cat... ||| Thag is not a cat, that is a pig ||| I think I have better chances of jumping into orbit….!!!!

Dyam, that’s an insult… ||| She knew what she was doing wearing all black ||| This was the best upgrade video so far. Sarah has great energy and a wonderful personality, Arlo ""best supporting actor"". ||| Linus actually had a heart attack seeing the gift card and cpu ||| Who else is rewatching just to see more of arlo? ||| 3:00 This could be a completely serious statement if he was talking about modded minecraft.
Even my 4070 struggles to keep 30 FPS in certain configs. ||| This is the Best prank on YouTube!!! ||| 12:15 couldnt you just raise the radiator few milimeters?? ||| she’s beautiful❤❤❤❤❤❤ ||| 3060 for a 5000 dollar setup is crazy ||| Now that I think about it, they're not banging but they could be cuz they're both awkward nerds ||| a 3060 with that kind of budget is criminal ||| The cat 😂 ||| Sarah has gone very Hyper and she is so much fun ||| We love Arlo ||| The cat is so fluffy and chonky and I love it ||| Wonder How Many Pins On The Bottom Of The Keyboard Switches She Bent! It Takes Skill And Luck Not To Bend A Switch Pin! I Think Linus Bent The One He Forced In! ||| Sarah used her new-streaming set up once then never again ||| I actually laughed so much ||| I revisit this purely for the Linus trolling giftcard bit... and end up staying for the sensible tech upgrade items that fit my needs too... unfortunately I dont have a major sponsor to buy all the nice things but some day! ||| She looks almost exactly like Alexandria Daddario but with a happier face lmao ||| I wonder how the cat is today, 2 years later. Hopefully still OK, alive and well. She was certainly well fed😊. ||| 2 years later and it’s still my dream upgrade as a graphic designer and gamer lol ||| 19:50 bro may get called racist after that lol ||| 10:36 bro had to clarify… ||| I need a 5k starting out setup. You can upgrade the air where my pc would be in my house. 😅 ||| Every single one of Linus' employees are cat people ||| First one ||| 4k in 10 months for starbucks isn't far off for a lot of people lmao ||| Whats this type of cat called?!?! I wanna google more cats like Arlo 
Also this is one of the thought thru builds, very close to complete ||| Sarah: ""Oh I forgot we need to put the keycaps in the right order!""
Linus: ""You don't have to.""

Hehe. He got me again that rascal ||| 1:19 pause it right there, my god😮 ||| And here we are in November 2024 and Sarah hasent been live since April 2022 ||| butt ||| Sarah what now? ||| i fucking hate that you guys are in Canada , i would absolutely be like that guy that showed up and never left lmao yall are my kinda people man ||| dont laugh dont laugh dont laugh dont laugh dont laugh dont laugh 







Sarah BUTT HAHAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHH ||| i'll be honest, this woman is perfect ||| Finally someone with the same last name as me haha ||| Sarah What ?? ||| Sarah is infectiously insane or insanely infectious. So fun. Great episode   And the cat. 🐈‍⬛ ||| She not the only person who is Engineering Team, Design Team, and Creative Team seem to have more thought out upgrades that they fits their needs than their wants.  Now the ones who tend to be the ""Gamers"", Editors, Writers, and the Camera Crew types seem to be the ones who tend to go after their wants.  In many cases everyone has seem to have sick system setups with few irregularities here and there to begin with.  Watching these videos from 2 - 4 years ago, I have to keep reminding myself that lot of CPUs and GPUs were the latest tech at the time. ||| I have seen this video and it still brings a smile to my face.  Yes, her items that she pick for her upgrade have been thought out and fit together nicely.  Considering her position at LMG, as in what her job actually is, overflowed into decisions.  She plans on using her system for both Productivity with some gaming.  One of the few upgrades I am glad she won Intel upgrade rather than a later AMD upgrade. ||| 16:40 is what you all wanted ||| Never trust a person who doesn’t like cats. So LTT gets a big ass seal of approval ||| now that i started watching all the tech upgrades from before, i gotta say LTT has pretty cool employees, that i dont see as the usual suspects in most videos. also, pretty sick setup! ||| This should have been on V1 channel, fecking love it 👌 ||| I mean look at th3 views we all love sarah we need her in more videos ||| Arlo stole all my heart right Meow! ❤ Ultimate Fluff Nugget Upgrade 😻 ||| man she is so gorgeous ||| She is a cutie pie... ||| Sarah is gorgeous and seems like a genuinely wonderful person. ||| Jurassic Park sticker. 😍 ||| sarah has bacardi in a pump bottle i love it ||| is that her name or it that a nickname becausE??? ||| one of my dogs name is arlo ||| did anyone notice ,  ARLO'S designated title is NOT FAT CAT. ||| Why Arlo so chunky.💀💀💀💀 ||| There is no content on her twitch. And it says she hasn’t been live for two years. ||| Sarah is so cuutee..😊😊 ||| she looks just like sam from cobra kai oml ||| Intel?  Why ||| NO WAY HER LAST NAME IS “BUTT”… ||| Those bottles in the background tho 👀 ||| Wow she has some energy, tripped Linus right out with the coffee card, would struggle with different size minitors ||| I wonder if anyone has ever decided on AMD when doing the intel upgrade... I would just to be ""that"" guy haha ||| Isn't Sarah the one the internet bullied LTT into hiring? ||| I really like Sarah's personality and energy, but man, I do not like her voice. ||| First time i see an artist that is that energetic ||| She got an absolute amazing amount of stuff with her money. ||| decent ASSets ||| Her scream laughing has got to be the most ridiculous thing in the world. ||| Quit a few of these have ""we rented u a fake home"" vibe. ||| $4000 of starbucks was wild! LMAO seeing Linus's reaction was funny af. ||| Butt is a family title in Pakistan ... I guess her father is from Pakistan ||| She's a funny little prankster. ||| 18:06 linus after this be like : hand me the fucking glock ||| Is it just me or did Linus say ""proseffonal"" instead of professional at 9:40 ? ||| Most surprising thing abt this video, is that linus didn't know universal audio ||| 11:15 thanks Intel👉👈🥺 ||| The cat is just getting bullied


Ps. I am binge watching all $5000 tech upgrades🥴 ||| Sarah butt kinda look like a Wallace and gromit character ||| why the  3060 😅 ||| I don't think Linus understands women in the slightest LOLLLL ||| 18:47 i have the same exact benq monitor and it randomly blacks out just like this ||| 13:40 yeah yeah i put it in 😈 ||| Hearing Linus in the background "" Your impressed by the wrong stuff"". Disappointed dad voice. ||| 20:06 That laugh made my day! 😄 ||| 'Ex Machina'! Great movie. ||| You don't live here! You can't take me off my perch! ||| I’ve seen all the videos from this series and this is definitely my favorite. She reaaaaaally got cool stuff for 5,000 and love her laugh ||| i love her ||| I know it’s 2 years later, but XLR cables have usb, and 3.5mm options too ||| her appearance makes me feel uncomfortable.😅 ||| ""This is Sarah Butt, we're not going in the front door for obvious reasons.."" I'm just sitting there like, 😳 ""Are we not doing 'phrasing' any more?"" ||| 22:22 what whas that sound? ||| Bruh the volt is good but it’s because it has a compressor module the 1176. I want to see an audio tech video. You know talking about stuff like ssl Neumann cool audio stuff like that ||| I have no idea who this gal is, but I adore her energy. She is a treat. And arlo is just gorgeous!

The pc was pretty cool too. ||| Arlo added so much character to the video 😂 ||| I got so afraid at 10:30 when the camera is on Sara and Linus goes ""why is you butt SOOO WIIIDE?""
The camera pans to the right revealing that fluffy-ass  cat he was talking to.
Good God... ||| 3060 is still a good card in 2024 ||| A 3060 in a 5k budget. Yikes ||| Should be spending that money on a last name change sheesh 😂 ||| she talks too much ||| Can we bring Sarah back for some more videos. Her energy and vibe is needed. ||| A 4,000 dollar starbuck gift card is crazy 😂😂 ||| It is interesting how Linus was so comfortable about it and knew where to find that bowl. ||| Can i have upgrade ||| That is the most chunkiest feline i have ever seen ||| Sarah plays Apex? Thats the only game I have played consistently the past three years lol a lady of culture I see ||| 1440p on a 3060... yikes! ||| ""your butt is soo wide!!.... THE CAT."" poor Linus has to clarify 😆 ||| Sarah is by far my favorite, not because she is a pretty lady(she is) but her energy is infectious! Just an amazing person ||| Love the vibe she brought and created with the budget!! 💖🌈 ||| How am I noticing at this point that Linus is the sad meme guy??? 😂😂😂😂😂
Oh my god ||| I love the aesthetic of her setup. I wish I have one like that! ||| is that a RTX 3060 OC 12gb from zotac but in white ( i have the same ) ||| Linus saying he wasn’t familiar with Universal Audio broke my heart. I’m a musician and literally the only gear I recommend people is UA stuff ||| Please don"" t make her build any more computers, do the world a favor. ||| Love it how arlo tries to get at the alcohol ||| Sarah must be tired of being the BUTT of our jokes 😂 ||| Is Sarah dating Jake because if I remember Arlo was jake's cat ||| volt1 best interface for audio engineers :) ||| thats a clean set up ||| Sarah is joy incarnate ||| As someone who makes games for fun a 3060 will not do it. a 4090 will but the upcoming Titan AI is one I'm saving for. ||| This is the best upgrade we've seen yet, with KallMeKris being a good second. ||| Linus, you're mistaken. She is impressed by the right stuff XD ||| The cameraman noticed Sarah’s bakery in one of the shots 😂 ||| would ||| Finaly a extreme tech upgrade i actually have a similar system to ||| i gooned to this ||| i have to say as an artist that knows nothing about computers those sketchbooks are awesome. ||| 10:34 
""Your butt is so wide, the cat"" 
That was a damn good save Linus😂 ||| most normal set up by far ||| Its actually really refreshing to hear someone not necessarily in the tech side of LTT knowing their stuff and not really having anything for a weird reason. Stayed under budget enough to pick up to extra bits that complimented everything else - nice! ||| A 3060? Fire her immediately. ||| Why no video tablet? Jk, I have one and I watch the main monitor anyway. ||| Sarah is the reason i wanna move to canada or somewhere in the usa close to canda xD ||| Linus not being familiar with UAD blows my mind ||| Shes super cute ||| dam shes so cheery its contagious,  i luv it lol i wish i had a friend like here. she reminds me of this one kid i met in my language class lowkey sounds like her too. but sicc build ||| she broke the ""n"" key, now she can't type the gamer word ||| why the butt ? ||| Oh her voice is like nails on a blackboard 😖😖 I really tried to watch it all but gave up.. ||| blue switches ||| I need a tech upgrade",0.0986865628568921,0.9884365797042848,16,1,0.08,200

Pre-order now at rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/order",gaming,16164413.0,419652.0,44139,PT6M6S,"BEST game ever made!!!! ||| can't wait for gameplay video for gtavi ! ||| The voice of female narrator remind me of AOE 3 Amelia somehow ||| just thaanks ||| The best game of all time until RD3 comes out ||| Bro this game is so Goated 😂 ||| spoiler alert : dutch had a plan ||| You coming? Buddy 😂 ||| Me hand fighting someone, the npc: imma block this man 69 times ||| Best game in the history ||| I still wonder who was the lady who narrated this ||| The details and beauty of this game surpasses others.Such a realistic and beautiful masterpiece ❤ ||| I love sending this to friends that never played this game ||| For reason I hate this game
 Gameplay it's more real but Hard to shoot enemy in rifle and revolver guns it's not enjoyable like GTA 5 
Only graphics are good appreciate it but atleast they've could made gameplay enjoyment it would best related other game ||| 3:28 Noticing 6/7 years later but Arthur is in west elizabeth near blackwater they must have disabled the wanted dead or alive for this preview build. ||| if you havent complete the mission or the game arthur died ||| Rockstar needs to give this precious gem of a game love again, I think most gamers would agree ||| 2025, anyone?🤔🤔 ||| Give us a currect gen update please! We want to replay it so bad but not at 30 fps😢 ||| DJ Khaled: we da best
Dutch: we just need a little money ||| For me personally this is the best game I've played from Rockstar games since GTA san andreas ||| Who is the narrator? ||| Best ever story I play ||| THE GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME 🔥🔥.. ROCKSTAR NAILED IT ||| BTW, this is going to be the last non-woke game rockstar puts out for a while.  The entire company went woke in 2021.  DEI has infested their writing and production team. ||| I'm on my 8th playthrough since I found the game in August (2024).  And it just keeps on giving.  I find new things and new ways of doing things with every play through. ||| 2025 ||| The greatest game i've played to date! ||| Here because it'll be 60fps soon ||| best 60$ ever ||| still one of the best games today ||| This isn't one of the best games ever made, this THE best game ever made.

I'll never understand why Rockstar let Online die a slow death.  It had more potential than any other game you can name.

The only thing that makes sense is infighting at Rockstar.  The GTA guys were jealous about how excellent Red Dead is, so that somehow lead to Red Dead losing funding to make the GTA team happy.

It's only because they know Red Dead is 10x the game GTA is. ||| 3:33 is that Arthur Morgan in New Austin? 🤣🤣 ||| I’m watching a trailer for a game I already beat like 10 times now.. this is one of the greatest experiences to ever exist ||| Congratulations everyone that worked on this game. It lived up to the hype. ||| Absolute cinema 🙅🏻 ||| They made arthur look like another mude protagonist lol ||| Damn this game looks crazy good ||| This is Art❤ ||| Thank you rockstar introduce me about arthur ||| Seeing this gameplay trailer makes me so excited to see gta VI’s wonder if it will have two parts like this one did ||| 4:06 still one of my favourite clips ||| The vkice acting in this game is peak. Ill never forget the feeling. ||| I know im not the only one who when under heavy fire behind cover just decides to break cover shotgun in hand walking slowly like a boss proficiently clearing out enemies and ducking back into cover to get my bearings😂 then back out to pop some heads . This game man👌🤌 ||| Still playing this in 2025 I feel like this game was underrated when it came out ||| Still playing it to this day. Easily in my top 3 games of all time. Shame they let the online section rot. ||| I'm still impressed by this trailer, even though I've finished the game several times. ||| This is the game GTA VI should be compared to not that decade old GTA V ||| Imagine chinnese without  great  3kingdom war can they become powerfull a s now ||| just PERFECT!! ||| ps5 60fps ||| They showed Arthur and the gang in the Great Plains area but in the actual game as soon as Arthur steps foot in that area he gets attacked by Pinkertons. Classic Rockstar move smh. ||| Best game ever. ||| This just shows how far rockstar games have come. ||| 6 years later this still hits hard ||| This looks like GTA V after seeing the GTA VI trailer ||| Pour du contenu tech visuel, rÃ©tro-futuriste ou analytique ||| this game is a piece of art ||| On rare occasions character will compliment a NPCs horse or wagon if you are on a wagon or a nicer horse you will get compliments from NPCs 


Games incredible the story is too good no wonder the memes about countless hours spent on this game 😂 ||| Absolute masterpiece ||| I still play this game and find new stuff ||| Next gen patch when?? ||| epic ||| Playing this game for 5-6 years  is amazing, I still find new things I never see. in story mode ||| If Rockstar got this masterpiece to run on a PS4... They can get GTA VI to run on PS5. ||| This game is one of the best things about this world, if not the only best thing about this world. ||| All these years and I still have goosebumps ||| Fine! I'll play again for the nth time. ||| I hope GTA VI will have this Official Gameplay Video too.. ||| 7 years later and its STILL one of the best games ive ever played... ||| That gun switch at 4:09 I still don’t know how to do that trick switch handgun to shotgun without opening the weapon wheel ||| Rockstar we need gameplay trailer for GTA VI like this ||| eles entregaram muito mais do que foi mostrado ||| Xbox times few years back, nostalgiaaa ||| Still looks incredible ||| What? This was only 6 years ago? I thought it closer to 10. ||| I can’t wait to hear this woman talk about GTA VI gameplay ||| the only nitpick I had with this gameplay trailer is that they sort of lied about camping system lol. funding or supplying for the camp made no real changes in the game story at all. Its only boot your honor..
these lines of sentence would give the players exaggerated expectation you know. ||| I didn’t believe the second GTA trailer saying the game was gonna look that good until I’m rewatching this. This just got me SOO much more hyped ||| This game need a next gen version! It's awesome ||| Up there with the very top best game I have ever touched ||| youtube recomanded me this just now ||| 60 fps ? ||| Gta gameplay trailer 😢 ||| Here just to give ya'll flowers for creating my favorite game of all time. Getting ready for a GTA video similar to this one soon! ||| Это первый трейдер? Всего 15 лямов? Пипец люди гта 6 ждут. ||| After to see this again... Im absolutely trust in Rockstar Games for GTA VI ||| Comming from GTA VI Which trailer 1 2 or 3 ||| Can’t wait for the gta vi one ||| Best game ever made ||| Thank you Rockstar. Only company that care for real gamers ||| Waiting for gameplay trailer for gta vi need it so badly! ||| 1:37 that animal was near jason house in trailer 2 ||| Can't wait for the GTAVI equivalent to this one ||| I remember the hype around this trailer, and to this day this game is one pf the best games ive ever  played ||| Proof they dont lie with the trailers ||| Where is Undead Nightmare pt 2??! ||| Whoever is new and old here after GTA VI ||| I vividly remember watching this and thinking there was no way it would actually look this good in game, especially on a PS4 but this is 100% accurate to what we got. One of the greatest technical achievements in gaming full stop. ||| Masterpiece. Makes me wanna play it for a third time ||| I think I’ll replay this again before GTA VI ||| Seriously, give us a 4k 60fps patch on Xbox series x! ||| It's still hard to believe this game was running on a base PS4 and Xbox One. Rockstar developers are not humans, man ||| Who else is waiting for GTA VI Official Gameplay Video?

Loved this 80 film ||| Kee- _RIPES!!_ Watching this, I remember how I thought that they got really lucky with the 'Vacation' series because you can see all the same faults there. It's like SNL & all American sit-coms. They establish the characters in the theme song that explains the premise, or here with the yearbook.
Then, like a movie written by a 12-year-old, then edited by stoners, nothing progresses past that point! they just keep making the same tired joke over & over as if, like the stoners & this film, doing anything else *might* interfere with their high.
The shelves stocked with creamed or powdered 'cafeteria delight,' people literally just shouting at each other what we already read they were voted 'most likely' for at the beginning. When Monty Python had a couple of characters who kept misunderstanding, they were in one scene of one movie. Joke made, they moved on.
But here, it's scene after scene as if, again, this is written by a 12-year-old who will always think that stoners are funny. 
So far, the nudity has been _by FAR_ the highlight. ||| Good video ||| It's been awhile since the last time I watched this movie ||| I see why I never heard of this film prior to a few days ago now... ||| Christ!

By the way, I am 60 myself now, and the 60th anniversary of the shooting falls tomorrow; I'll be thinking of all the American lives altered and destroyed by this single event so many years ago... ||| JFK Ben-Gurion Battle of Letters
Stolen USN Nuclear Materials
NUMEC DIMONA SAMSON
MOSSciAD Dulles Angleton Harel
🇮🇱 1963 Coup D'état 💥

In Ben-Gurion's view going Nuclear was existential. JFK put his foot down & the inspections were coming. Ben-Gurion stepped down as the coup got the green light. Dimona was Israel’s prime reason for eliminating Kennedy & replacing him with Johnson. But there were others. The Kennedy brothers were at the origin of a procedure to reduce the influence of the American Zionist Council by the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. In October 1963, Attorney General Robert Kennedy gave the AZC a 72-hour notice to register as a “foreign agent.” After John Kennedy’s assassination, the AZC escaped this procedure, and its lobbying division, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (or AIPAC), became the most powerful lobby in the United States, and an indispensable tool for the corruption and intimidation of American elected officials, and for the control of American foreign policy ( morphing into a hydra of AIPAC/assorted groups, who are know to DC insiders as ""The Lobby"" ). A third motive for the Dallas coup was Kennedy's support for the Palestinian cause and his sympathy for Egyptian President Abdel Nasser. As late as November 20, 1963, Kennedy’s representative at the United Nations demanded the implementation of Resolution 194 and the return of the 800,000 Palestinian refugees, causing strong protest in Israeli circles. After Kennedy's death, American foreign policy in West Asia was radically reversed without the American public realizing it. Johnson cut economic aid to Egypt and increased military aid to Israel to 92 million in 1966, more than the total of all previous years combined. To date indigenous Palestinians do NOT have a right of return inside Israel, while foreign Jewry worldwide, can make ""Aliyah.""

Start pulling the threads... Abraham Zapruder, Dal-Tex Building Mossad Front, the ""Dallas Citizens Council"" of J*wish businessmen aka B’nai B’rith, Reuben Efron, Jacob Rubenstein, Mickey Cohen, Menachem Begin, Irgun, Hank Greenspun's ""letter."" 

*PERMINDEX:* the primary shareholder in Permindex was the Banque De Credit International of Geneva, founded by Tibor Rosenbaum, an arms procurer and financier for the Mossad. The Mossad sponsored Swiss bank was the chief ""money laundry"" for Meyer Lansky, the head of the international crime syndicate and an Israeli loyalist whose operations meshed closely on many fronts with the American CIA. The chairman of Permindex was Louis M. Bloomfield of Montreal, a key figure in the Israeli lobby and an operative of the Bronfman family of Canada, long-time Lansky associates and among Israel's primary international patrons. Pull on the Permindex thread.

 63 Winterland Ice Skating Rink... After the assassination LBJ immediately dropped pressure to stop Israels Nuclear program, dropped proposals to register Zionist Lobby as a foreign agent, American foreign policy in the ME reversed course, & later covered up Israels False Flag attack on the USS Liberty. LBJ was compromised. Nothing by today's standards, but scandalous enough back then to sink him. LBJ had off book political/$ connections to *SAM BLOOM.* Sam Bloom, a prominent member of the Texan J community, whose name was found in Jack Ruby's address book. It was Bloom who intervened with the Dallas Police Department to allow the press to film Oswald’s transfer, giving Ruby the opportunity to shoot him dead. Sam Bloom, pull on that thread! 

*""I did it for the Jewish people.""*
~ Jack Ruby, confided to Rabbi Hillel Silverman

Ruby’s defense lawyer William Kunstler also claims in his memoir that Ruby told him: “I did it for the Jews,” repeating on several occasions: “I did this that they wouldn’t implicate Jews.” During Kunstler’s last visit Ruby handed him a note in which he reiterated that his motive was to “protect American Jews from a pogrom that could occur because of anger over the assassination.”[3] There is only one possible interpretation of Ruby’s words: he must have known, and those you tasked him with killing Oswald must have known, that if Oswald was tried, the Jewish hand in JFK’s assassination would likely be made apparent.

Jacob Rubenstein, aka Jack Ruby, had fore knowledge of the JFK assassination according to FBI informant, Bob Vanderslice of Dallas. On the day of the assassination, Jack Ruby invited the  informant to come and “watch the fireworks” with him at the fateful parade, according to newly released documents.

Jack Ruby — convicted of killing Oswald, who shot Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 — then attended the parade with the FBI informant.

“He was with Jack Ruby and standing at the corner of the Postal Annex Building facing the Texas School Book Depository Building at the time of the shooting,” reads the FBI document, released as a part of the JFK files.

Before his ""suicide"" *George de Mohrenschildt* claimed Jews, the Jewish mafia was after him and wanted to kill him.

THE TIMES OF ISRAEL
By RON KAMPEAS 
2 August 2023

✡️ Arlen Specter, while on the Warren Commision, pushed the ""magic bullet.""

Oliver Stone's kosher gatekept film, JFK, was produced by Arnon Milchan.

Arnon Milchan worked for decades as an Israeli spy, associated with MOSSAD/LAKAM. He was tasked with securing technology for Israel’s secret nuclear weapons program, economic espionage, & arms smuggling. At one point he operated 30 companies in 17 different countries. Milcharn reportedly became a key operative for LAKAM chief Benjamin Blumberg and top spy Rafi Eitan, who ran jailed spy Jonathan Pollard and infiltrated a U.S. company to obtain tons of highly-enriched uranium. Milchen, who is good friends with current Israeli President Shimon Peres, also said that he helped Israel obtain key nuclear equipment and information while Peres established the *Dimona nuclear reactor.

Milchan's company, Heli Trading Co., brokered the shipment of 800 krytons — sophisticated triggers for nuclear weapons — from the California company MILCO International Inc. to the Israeli Ministry of Defense between 1979 and 1983.

In 1985, the U.S. indicted and extradited MILCO President Kelly Smyth on 30 counts of smuggling and making false statements.

Here's what Smyth told FBI agents in Los Angeles (via IRMEP):

Smyth details his recruitment by Arnon Milchan, meetings with Benjamin Netanyahu who then worked at smuggling front Heli Trading (Milchan Brothers Trading Company) in Israel, and how the ""Project Pinto"" smuggling operation was rolled up after his arrest for smuggling 800 nuclear triggers and subsequent flight from the U.S.

Milchan denies that he knew about the nuclear triggers, which require a U.S. State Department munitions license to be exported. In any case, it's clear that he was integral to Israel's nuclear program.

Michael Collins Piper book: 
*FINAL JUDGEMENT* ||| Man even now watching this trailer gives me goosebumps!!! They had a stellar cast!! This movie is one of the best of all time!!! I think this movie should be shown to our children and their children and their children’s children….this is something that needs to be a part of history the way Oliver Stone wrote this and how all the actors came together to make such a classic movie!! If I had children I would make them watch this…true definition of a classic!!! ||| Did anyone watch this movie thinking it was going to be a biopic about JFK and end up disappointed that it was just about his assassination? ||| There will never be a better President than JFK. He is my hero, and the first Catholic President of the US of A. ||| This year is going to be the 60th anniversary! ||| Secret sources the miss Monroe will return and so will the Kennedy brothers this is not a joke i pray ||| Still getting goosebumps watching this movie, and Ive watched it probably 10 times. Today, 9-11 is a perfect day to see it again. Black is white, and white is black. ||| It was Hickey! ||| I broke down and rented this. What a collection of made up facts, lies, and fabrications. No wonder a generation of people think it’s a conspiracy. ||| “JFK” (1991) is undeniably Oliver Stone’s MASTERPIECE.  

The movie was meant to be an assault on the Warren Commission.  PERIOD.  In no way was historical accuracy an absolute priority.  

As it has rightly been stated : “[…] for cogent scripting, directorial audacity and bravura acting, this mythic, epic three-hour ‘ARTISTIC INTERPRETATION’ is hard to beat.”  

ONE MUST-SEE CULT CLASSIC‼️  💙🎬💙 ||| I'm tired of all the fake Southern accents. (Costner; Bacon..) ||| Look, I started questioning all about JFK death when two children of RFK came out publicly (after decades of silence) and said right out they did not believe the US governments “story” about RFK’s assassination.   They said it by boldly standing with Sirhan Sirhan all these years.   I believe them.   Our govt. has been out of control since 1963. ||| RFK for president!!!!!! ||| Jfk movie Liydlaal Lilydale ||| 0:53 Newman in this movie?😂 ||| after robin hood this ||| Interesting. ||| People don’t realize Jack Ruby warned of our country coming under a whole new form of government. Sounds like what’s going on now ||| the crazy thing is i just googled this film to see if it was factually correct... and all i seen was websites of big media corporations stating that its all made up and oliver stone is a basket case. i seen oliver stone on joe rogan and its clear that he has done thorough research and besides he wouldnt make such a big movie if it was all based on lies. thats why i struggle to believe anything that the news says. jfk was obviously killed by people closest to him and just like the twin towers, it was done by greedy people who want to run the world and are able to get away with whatever they want. it makes me sick. i also believe theres a lot more to this russia/ ukraine war and covid was very sketchy too. some of the richest ppl in the world made fortunes. ||| Sooo many great actors in this film?! 👀 ||| Can somebody confirm how original is this movie compared to what happened in reality? ||| Oliver STONE IS GENIUS! I A True AMERICAN 🇺🇸 Patriot Hero! Brings This film 🎥out - Forces The Government to admit it’s a conspiracy and more than one person doing the shooting epic ! Now 60 years LATER - Let’s finish this Now ! ||| Great and amazing movie! Let justice be done or the heavens fall! ||| Something no one in the media dares to talk about is of all the players that had a motive to kill Kennedy ONE is not mentioned. Kennedy was insisting that the US inspect Israel’s Nuclear Bomb program. After Kennedy was murdered no US President ever brought up the subject again. LBJ also covered up Israel’s criminal attack on the USS Liberty. Who controls our money ? Could that have anything to do with it. ||| Only Oliver Stone could deliver something like this. His love for history and cinema comes together so beautifully and makes his movies historic and groundbreaking. Grateful to have seen this masterpiece. Everything was great! ||| Release the hidden Truth ||| What's done in darkness will come to light ||| 1990-99 was the best era for the film industry. ||| One of the most important and best films ever made ||| I remember calculating how old is he at release of the documents. Trumpo released some but not all . Haven’t had a chance to read them yet though ||| tommy lee sent me ||| It's his view of things.  That is understood.  But darnit, doesn't Oliver Stone give a convincing argument for conspiracy theorists?! ||| The common people expect politicians to stand up for them against the powerful elite.. and when one stood up  - he was executed in public. 
And what did the people do? they crawled back right into their homes and watched basketball. The common public the biggest hypocrites. ||| This always works for me. Instead of seances you pray. The holy spirit is a revealer of truth. Knowing what I know about federal, I'd have to probably say it was an inside job. Write down on a piece of paper the morals of that day. Ask yourself, did Kennedy comply. The Irish are into cover ups y Nazism too. It just takes truth. ||| One of My Bucket List Movies To Watch Someday! ||| Lol the big enchilada! RIP John candy ||| Amazing how someone so central to historical events was repeatedly placed in the hands of people who are obsessed with my insides. I’m glad that’s getting addressed so I can live in a way most people so central to historical events get to live. ||| ""The Story That Won't Go Away."" ||| Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick ||| I personally think that CIA, mob, and many more were involved. Unfortunately we will never know the full truth ||| Kevin Costner is so damn hot. Why can't every man look like this ||| Shotsfromthegrassyknoll ||| bit long, tho ||| Good trailer, makes you want to see the movie. However, check out the modern trailer. You won't be disappointed. ||| Crusader for truth and justice Stone had no qualms about packing over 80 demonstrable lies into this film and implicating a lot of innocent people as being party to murder and treason. ||| Today I seen that movie on DVD📀 It's a great movie to watch😊 ||| JFK es una película inmensa en todo sentido positivo!👍🙋🏼‍♂️ ||| Who else saw Dexter @2:02 ||| Great work of Entertainment. Terrible history. Just like Hamilton ||| This movie had an unbelievable cast. ||| Oliver Stone is a Putin's lackey boy",0.0662342253216775,0.9912801384925842,5,1,0.05,100

I forgot what I wanna say ||| 死を望まなくなったきっかけの1つ ||| This movie is a parody of horror movies ||| I remember watching this when I was 8 years old. ||| I don't get it what happened? ||| Hello everyone i came from future. ||| チュパピムニャニョ ||| Watching this for the first time tonight after first reading a summary about it in the early 2000s on my old computer, but never got around to it. This was the era when Japanese horror reigned.  Takashi Nomura is in this, and Ryo Ishibashi of Audition fame! I'm already excited. ||| Classic masterpiece ||| how did i get here? ||| Somebody explain the movie very detailed and that way I can decide if I wanna watch it ||| I pissed my pants just from the trailer. ||| 沙耶子かな？ ||| My favorite film. ||| 自殺サークル並感 ||| 有連結嗎 ||| WOW ||| I only came for Japan is for anime ||| グロすぎ((((;゜Д゜))) ||| W T F ||| Suicide club contains two of my favorite things, japanese school girls and suicide ||| Spooky. ||| I don't get it......what's up with Japanese movies and hair..... ||| i remembered watching this as a kid and it's terrifying ||| I saw it with my own TWO EYES!😈 ||| And now I have to watch it. 
.-. ||| It’s all in French. I’m actually happy for once that I am forced to learn French. ||| Ya know, I've always been frustrated with the horror genre. I can think of plenty of games or movies that rely on cheap scares, like it's just fucking sad that people actually think some some bullshit is considered ""scary"" or ""horrifying"" by some people. I know horror, like comedy is very subjective, but come on, let's be honest horror as a genre has taken a massive shit in recent years. And I can only count a select few movies or games that actually scare me. But....after watching this trailer....yeah be careful what you wish for. I mean fuck what is up with Japan? Like they do horror to damn well, actually no it's beyond horror, this shit is fucking nightmare fuel. ||| 한국인 손 ||| This advertisement is misleading! ||| ... Still trying to remember where the hair in the movie appeared... ._. ||| Damn Japanese ||| ayuda . donde la puedo veeeer? se ve buenísima ||| μαλακα κοντοπα τι με εφερες να δω??? ||| Wait !! this isn't Suicide Squad ||| 薬やガスで自分を殺すために良いですか？ ||| Japan, WTF?!?!? ||| The worst thing about this is the fucking silence. It really makes you pay attention to what's happening. ||| battle royal or suicide club ??? .... ||| now i gotta jack off ||| Hair. It's terrifying in Japan! ||| 怖い。 ||| Les trailers sont à revoir la moitié de celui-ci c'est une photocopieuse... ||| What the fuck is with Japan and hair!! I swear, in every goddamn horror movie! ||| just passing through utube ||| hayyyyyy chinos locoooos locoooooos ajajaj me encanta ||| when i first heard about this movie i saw the picture of the girls lined up in front of the train, at first i thought i was simply because of some stupid internet trend or weird cult they were following which made me extremely angry but now that i see from the trailer that its a supernatural horror film, its excused lol

if my initial assumption was correct though, i will probably hate the movie ||| Ill fucck da shiit out of the bleeding gurl.... Ill let her puzzy bleeding as well nikka ||| FSK? ||| wow... seem hard. Look cool ||| gross
 ||| I knew 3D printing exists back then in Japan! ||| wtf some shit just got faxed ||| This one is so gross! ||| sick ||| ¿Alguien que suba la peli? -_- ||| this made me laugh ||| Great Film ||| I like how in the movie the blood was pretty fake like it was orange half the time ||| Man, that was a waste a lot of a cute girl ||| I like the part when the kids are all hanging out on the roof and some girl gets a briliant idea "" Hey guys! lets jump off of the building :D!!!!!!! and they're all like OMFG yes!!!!!!  ||| @KokoaShuzen uhhh I DID.....there's no excuse for such a fucked up project. ||| @shad0wMata Watch the movie before passing judgement please. ||| no point. no sense. just senseless violence.

Good Luck ||| Hoffman and Voight.....simply fantastic till this day.....what a great movie....and the soundtrack...simply marvelouse.....damn again. ||| The perfect Duo.....what a classic movie....damn. ||| Arent we all Joe Buck.....so true. ||| One of the best movie I've ever seen, in 1970. A great critic of society, a great friendship between two desperate guys, hard memories of Joe Buck, and a wonderful psychedelic party. At the end, the death of Ricco in Greyhound bus, as they finally get to Miami. A sad movie. With beautiful music. ||| Incredible. Period. ||| I have never seen this film. I was too young to view when it came out and life has kept me busy over these 60bds. What a shame. I will save it for a quiet time. ||| The movie is a surreal masterclass in urban male alienation and loneliness with one iconic scene after another, acting that sears through the screen and an unforgettable musical score. ||| I havent watched this movie. I know it won the Oscars.
I thought it was Al Pacino😂 ||| :-) ||| I'm fucking here! ||| I loved this movie ever since I was a shorty nigga in skool. ||| This movie holds up... 50 years later and it’s still just as incredible. ||| Classic movie, ,,, ||| Movie from riptide ||| Wow, Angies dad is so cute
Real actors for sure ||| I refuse to believe it has been 50 years since this movie came out. I had just made a trip to Big Spring shortly before this movie came out. I was 24 and madly in love. I'm now 74 and not with the love of my life, but every time I hear this song it takes me back. Several years ago I had occasion to travel back through Big Spring. It has changed and deteriorated as much as me. You can never do something again, once it done you can try something similar but never the same. ||| Wow, Dustin really looks and sounds like 70s Al Pacino here 🤯 ||| It gets better the more you watch it! ||| You can tell people’s ages on here by what they think of this movie. ||| Rain man brought me here ||| THE FLEX... ||| Doug?

It's about a guy who quits his job and moves to New York City. This cowboy is running from himself!""
-Vance Joy, Riptide ||| One of my all time favorite's , everything about this movie is just brilliant.  The strange relationship between Joe Buck and Ratso Rizzo....it's a classic  buddy movie with a twist. Well deserving of the Oscar that year. ||| Rewatched it last night, it is a fantastic film and one of the Best films ever made! It is funny and Sad, very touching, ||| Me2 from Tokyo

I've got to get it. ||| One word.....Ratso Rizzo ! ||| looks like shit ||| 7 thumbs down humm silly bunnys !!! ||| I'm hell of a stud ||| I'm hell of a stud ||| Excellent film! So sad, but it's one of Dustin Hoffman's best performances and Jon Voight is either amazing. ||| One of the best movies ever. ||| I never forgot it... ||| I don't think it went detailed enough of the cold mean streets. ||| ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎯 ||| Sad Movie ||| I used to be more enamored by Hoffman's performance as Ratso. On repeat viewings, I am more impressed by Jon Voight. There's more colors to his characterization and an undercurrent of deep sadness., sexual confusion and a need for redemption. Dustin is still awesome, but he's just my second favorite performance now,. How many movies today give you TWO epic performances to choose from? Silver Linings Playbook? -don't make me laugh. ||| Best movie I've ever seen ||| Got something in my eye watching this movie. ||| Wow, that icky Anaconda villain was handsome... Now I see where Angelina Jolie got her face shape... :D ||| @moviedudeinc This would be a basic R rated film today. I saw it a few years ago. I'm sure the subject matter was really daring back then & it's still pretty edgy. ||| Marry me !! Joe Buck ??? ||| Been wondering that myself. ||| My all time favorite movie. ||| Thanks for doing this trailer (: Such a great classic! ||| Would this film be X rated by today standards and is this one of those inspiring films? ||| I think Dustin Hoffman was robbed of the Oscar. No one has ever deserved it as much as he did in those role IMO. ||| I think rizzo is actually cute :) I feel so sorry for him ||| This could have easily been my gateway film into film-making. ||| I love this movie ||| One of the greatest films ever made - magical. ||| I rented this a few weeks ago from my library,still a great movie...think Joe Buck shoulda stayed in Texas...classic movie ||| that was a great movie ||| Phenomenal.",0.0902630166207483,0.9961645603179932,7,1,0.0813953488372093,86

Lyrics

[Harry:]
You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[Niall:]
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Liam:]
All of the rumors, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Louis:]
Mini bars, expensive cars, hotel rooms, and new tattoos
And the good champagne, and private planes, but they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize that without you here life is just a lie
This is not the end
This is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[All:]
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Harry:]
So don't let me go
So don't let me go

[All:]
We can live forever

[Liam:]
Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know

[All:]
We can live forever

Balik na kayo 🥺 ||| 15 yrs guys. 😭 ||| We Never Left

Like echoes carved in sacred stone,
Our voices called, you weren’t alone.
Through every trial, loss, and theft,
We stayed with you—we never left.

From “Never Once” to final shows,
We held on tight and never froze.
You walked with us through storm and flame,
And still today, we love the same.

Fifteen years have come and gone,
But in our hearts, you carry on.
We miss your light, your harmonies—
The love you gave, the memories.

We cheered through highs, we cried through lows,
We felt your words beneath our clothes.
You're not a ghost of seasons past—
You're part of us. That bond will last.

We never left, we never will,
Our hearts are here, and beating still.
Though you're apart, we feel you near,
Each song you sang, we hold so dear.

Yes, time moved on, the world has spun,
But look how much your love has done.
If you return, we'll light the way—
But if you don't, it's still okay.

Because you gave us all your best,
And in our souls, your spirit rests.
We’ll always hope, but never grieve—
For in our hearts, you never leave.

We never left. We never strayed.
Our love remains, it never fades.
Together once. Together yet—
In every beat—we never left. ||| Happy 15 years to us❤️‍🩹. I know its gonna be a hard day but we Directioners will get through this together🤞🏼❤️‍🩹 ||| This Anniversary is diferent... but yeah their made history... we will always  love you guys🤍❤‍🩹 ||| Happy 15 years ❤ ||| A ||| 💙 ||| Moto Honda

Predestination International TRAILER 2 (2015) - Ethan Hawke Sci-Fi Thriller HD


The life of a time-traveling Temporal Agent. On his final assignment, he must pursue the one criminal that has eluded him throughout time.",movie,515450.0,841.0,190,PT1M31S,"Paradox. ||| they need to take out the face surgery from the trailer kinda gives it away in some shape or form ||| Your purpose in life will never change.  This is what this movie taught me. ||| The trailer doesn't do the movie justice. It's not like this. ||| This movie is masterpiece ...my mind was on storm after watching this movie ||| Super weird but actually one of my favorite movies ||| Talk about chicken and the egg. ||| Regardless of the formulaic appearance of this trailer, once again we have the silly spectacle of a film directed by Australians, with an American lead flanked by Australian actors and crew. That Australian actors working on this project were required to perform with North American accents, highlights once again that this is a habit that needs to be broken. This method of working is an uneasy compromise: invariably it produces culturally neutered works that are neither authentically American or Australian. 

If feature films made in countries other than USA - and only partly sponsored by American interest - continue to be universally tailored to the lowest common denominator (i.e. made on the understanding that as a rule, North American film consumers have little interest or understanding of cultures other than their own), then this is something I want nothing of. ||| I LOVE good time travel movies ||| I was mind fucked but i liked it. ||| This is one of the shitiest movie i have ever seen. ||| Impossible paradox, but a nice movie. ||| Looks good ||| If it's the same Heinlein short story I'm thinking of it's a pretty loos definition of based upon. ||| I've seen this movie. It was mind blowingly deep. |||  ||| Brilliant movie. ||| I thought Interstellar was the best movie of 2014... until I watched Predestination. ||| this was a shitty movie ||| Babadook is a Aussie film and it's a great Horror flick. Well acted and the kid is just awsome. Watch! ||| great movie well worth the watch ||| YES I can't believe a movie is being made based off of ""All You Zombies""!!!  Time paradoxes are the best ||| Why does everyone whisper in movies? ||| This movie is great, one of the best time travel movies of all time. ||| So many time travel movies coming out ||| How the first loop begun? ||| What is the piano song that is played at the start of the trailer called?? PLEASE HELP ||| This movie is great. Which came first though, the chicken or the egg? ||| This is a great movie people, go watch it!:) ||| Dear Ethan Hawke,
Fuck you.
Signed, Someone Who Actually Saw Getaway.  (you were in Training Day once. wtf) ||| Ladies and Gentleman -- John Titor, the Hollywood Version  ||| Saw this few weeks ago, was pretty fucking good. ||| this should at least get nominated for best picture and hawke should get nominated and the main chick. ||| I really like this movie.  ||| Wow...a move based off Heinlein's All You Zombies.

He goes to the timeline when he was a she and impregnates herself, she becomes pregnant, out comes the baby girl, he goes back and kidnaps the baby to bring her to another timeline, she grows up.

Finds out that the man who made her pregnant was actually her but changed into a man, in the end she decides to kill him that was her.

I have not seen this film but it looks like an interesting sci-fi action film. I have also not seen any trailers at the cinema or any TV spots for this film. The reason being that the release of this film in my own country is so limited that in my state it is being shown on one screen. The Australian film community is always bitching and moaning about the lacklustre box office of Australian made films as compared to what Hollywood blockbuster comes out every week. Yet when we do actually make a genre film of this calibre it gets the most limited release and nobody knows of its existence until the DVD release. Congratulations Australian film distributors you have screwed up again.  ||| Seen this twice, since its been out in Aus. Great movie, would recommend it to all, it probably wont end up getting the exposure it deserves. ||| Its definitely a sequel to Looper.  ||| Guardians of the galaxy trailer music

w5Xz2zLUoEM,Lost Horizon (1973),LOST HORIZON - 1973 - TRAILER,movie,79191.0,397.0,272,PT4M15S,"Lost horizon is a musical fantasy.❤🎉❤🎉 ||| 1:02, at the left edge is Mount Shuksan. ||| 1:02 This is Mount Baker, not the mountains in Shangri-La. They use the Cascades as the Himalayas Mountains, the movie locations are fake. I recognized Mount Baker. ||| The title song was lovely but they should have stopped there with the music and done it as a simple remake.  Several of the other numbers, which were very good,  could have been released as singles independent of the film. After that, it should have been made with a different director (John Frankenheimer? Francois Truffaut?) and different cast retaining only Liv,  Peter Finch and, of course, J. Gielgud. ||| It's too bad it wasn't me in that DC-3 crash instead of Michael York. ||| I believe this film is about to explode again. It’s so bad it’s good. It’s mind boggling. The only people missing are William Shatner and Phyllis Diller. ||| I recently read this book for the first time and would love to see a really talented director adapt it. It has a wonderfully evocative yet elusive atmosphere. I’ve never seen this and it look very goofy but I’m curious :) ||| I hate this film.. ||| Wonderful Movie!!! ||| Up until seeing it on Amazon and on here I never knew it was a theatrical release.    I only remember it on tv. ||| I remember seeing this on TV when I was 7 or 8. And all I remember is singing all songs and being so happy watching. 😊📺 ||| The end point of Hollywood musicals? ||| One of the last remnants of old Hollywood where Caucasian actors portrayed Asian characters. ||| Lost Horizon is considered a disaster of legendary proportions in every department.
It went so horribly at the box-office that earned the nickname “Lost Investment”, selected by Michael Medved & Razzie founder John Wilson as one of the worst movies of all time.

It was never released on VHS and didn’t had a DVD release until 2011.
Think about it, even Ed Wood (Plan 9 from Outer Space) and Hal P. Warren (Manos: The Hands of Fate) had DVD releases ahead of Lost Horizon.
That’s how bad it is people! ||| Ross Hunter's toupee at the very start of this trailer should give you an indication of the ""quality"" of this so-called movie! 😉 ||| Bem chato esse blá blá blá inicial. Porra...que porre. !!! ||| The lady dancing to Reflections is exactly how I dance. ||| ⁹ ||| Is it ||| Yes, I too, couldn't believe it, and was shocked when the cast suddenly started to burst into song, with ""The world is a circle"".! This song was frequently played on the radio at this time, but I couldn't believe it, when the film suddenly turned into a musical! I felt that the songs didn't fit well, with the film, and they also slowed up the progress of the film, too! 2 ||| I think the meaning of Lost Horizon was important to Ross Hunter and probably Humanity. Probably this was his most valued attempt over simply making money . But communicating the message of Lost Horizon I think is still something that hasn't been fully communicated in this movie version or any other yet. Each version tries to get across what the book wa's about. And each has its good point. I hope people continue to try to capture Lost Horizon ||| This production ended the producing career of Ross Hunter *and* the Burt Bacharach-Hal David songwriting partnership.  They had a falling out because Bacharach clashed with the studio and felt that David wasn't backing him up.

That is a great cast, though most of them seemed really confused about what they'd signed up for.  Only Sally Kellerman, James Shigeta and Bobby Van actually did their own vocals. ||| Maravilhoso! ||| Saw it at the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard a day after it came out theatrically in 1973. Those were the days, my friends. 🙂 ||| Prefer this version to the original. ||| Funniest Campiest musical ever seen! This relic belongs in 1950's and 1940's; not in the 1970's. ||| This looks horrible!  Frank Capra would have puked if he saw it... ||| Never saw Lost Horizon. There are Conways in Lost Horizon? The World Is a circle? Time and The Conways.
Share the Joy? Ah me. Reflections. If I could go back. Question me an answer.  Time and the Conways. ||| The lamasery was originally the castle built for Camelot (1967); it was turned into the Shaolin temple for the Kung Fu original TV series' pilot by Eugène Lourié in 1971, and used as the temple again through the series' production, 1973-1975. Just watch the series' pilot. It's the same building, with less plants. ||| 480p is NOT HD it's standard definition. Why claim it is, click bate maybe? Does not make me want to subscribe. ||| One of the reasons I hate musicals ||| Thank you for uploading this ||| Most people despise this film but I love it ! 😁😎 ||| 3:15 Groovy dancing ||| What is the woo-woo/flying saucer sound in the background? One you hear it you can't unhear it. ||| I barely remember this as a kid. Today, if i were to cast a musical,  all these actors would be the very last ones I would hire!  It is embarrising seeing Kellerman dancing and singing with George..... ||| I am Tibetan, the set and costumes are dog shit ||| 50 years ago, the book was study material for me at school (abridged version).

(In India). ||| Too bad this movie is nowhere available  . ||| This has been my favourite book since highschool I didn't know there was a movie. I will have to watch it. Thank you!! ||| I remember being in the big auditorium and watching this movie in the 70s I was probably 7 or 8 years old ||| When I saw George Kennedy I thought it was another Airport movie. ||| Classic case of white people stealing elements of ethnic culture, excluding actual ethnic people from the process, then profiting off it.  Really? John Gielgud as Chang and Charles Boyer as the ""high lama""?? Meanwhile the actual asians are servants to these people?? LOL! ||| What a dreadful film, it should be lost forever, totally cringing !! ||| I remember seeing that trailer. (It's one of those ""What were they thinking?"" productions...) ||| A musical was a good idea but the music didn't grab me. ||| I have read the book. A difficult but rewarding read. ||| About as far away from Bergman as Liv could get. ||| Don't know if the movie was as bad as the critics said it was, but with a really lame trailer like this, it's no wonder it flopped ||| “I never miss a Liv Ullmann musical”  Bette Midler ||| WHAT? THE AIRPLANE WAS USED IN RAIDERS? ||| I hear that around Hollywood, this film was called ""Lost Investment"" ||| Those who undermine the 1973 movie version of Lost Horizon simply forget that the story deals with far more than materialistic concepts which could be kept down within a cold and reductive technical analysis of the production but rather with the core of all spiritual quests. And it´s this majestic blending of spiritual significance with Bacharach´s soundtrack that has made it a unique embodiment of sublime but accessible spirituality in pop art. It has indelibly marked the lives of many western hearts who had just discovered the depth and wisdom of eastern philosophies and their alchemical paths in those days and will probably touch many more kindred souls in the next generations in this very special way.
It was only decades later, in 2010 exactly,  that I would finally find out, by the kind information from another Youtube user, that James Hilton´s work of fiction had actually been based on -or influenced by - an esoteric work itself: ""Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East "" by Baird T. Spalding (also available at amazon.com in a six volume set)! ||| I had never heard of this version of the movie so when the people got to Shangri-La and began singing and dancing all over the place, I was shocked. However, it really wasn't that bad. I think I would have had less of a shock if there had been a song in the beginning, sort of a warning that music would be following. It may have helped to add to the contrast of the outside world and Shangri-La. Also, I remembered that Peter O'Toole starred in a musical version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips. The author of Lost Horizon, James Hilton, also wrote Goodbye, Mr. Chips. I checked to see if there was a musical version of Random Harvest, also by the same author. Thankfully, there was not. Greer Garson's rendition of a WWI song in the original version was enough of a musical for anyone. ||| I ❤ this film! ||| In this version they turned the milquetoast palaeontologist character (played by Edward Everett Horton in the original) into a third-rate night club entertainer (played by Bobby Van), something for which I will never forgive them.  The music is tolerable to good in its own right (kudos to Bacharach and David for doing their best) but, unfortunately, I think this story and a musical format are largely incompatible. ||| The only person in this whole film who had any singing and dancing background was Bobby Van, and that isn't saying much.  I think Bette Midler summed it up best when she said ""I never miss a Liv Ullman musical.""  And if Ross Hunter thinks this is the finest film of the 46 he has produced, I would hate to see what he thinks is his worst. ||| I saw this when it came out. I had not seen the Frank Capra version yet. It was terrible. ||| I´m not sure if this film is horrible, or the seventies were horrible. Maybe both of them. ||| After ""Lost Horizon"" premiered and the critics panned it, Ross Hunter cut out some of the musical numbers, including a dance portion of ""Living Together, Growing Together"", and three vocals that were key to the story development of Peter Finch and Liv Ullmann's budding romance, and Finch's subsequent dilemma to stay or leave Shangri La.   The songs were ""I Come to You"" ""If I Could Go Back"" and ""Where Knowledge Ends, Faith Begins"".    Though both actors were dubbed, they were excellent matches to their talking voices and very believable.  Without these numbers, their whole relationship was ""gutted"".   Fortunately they've been restored to the DVD release.  The wild dance portion of ""Living Together"" has also been restored, thought it's something of a ""throw-away"" and seems a bit out of place at what's supposed to be a sedate monastery! ||| It's a trip to see it again after all this time though--I saw this in the movie theater when it came out. Yeah, it's dated. It's getting close to half a century old. ||| I must say I can't believe how the critics pounced on this movie. A Good but not great musical and one of the last of it's kind. ||| Doesn't say a lot about Ross Hunter's career if he considers this ""the finest movie I've ever produced.""  ||| I am not sure why Liam Barry thinks that the Seventies were f**king... He would probably also feel that ""Ben-Hur"", or ""The Robe"", or ""The Bible"", or ""Ten Commandments"" were disrespectful to God.   ||| right?
 ||| this was considered a good idea at the time?

When has lebron done that? I am talking about taking nobodies to the finals not other susperstars such as Ray Allen, D wade, Bosh, Kyrie, Kevin Love, etc. ||| I wonder if Jordan ever watched this movie.... imagine if they did a “Jordan doing work” movie back in the day.. would also be amazing. Number 1 and number 2 goat right there ||| This would have been even better if Bynum was healthy.

That's a Bruce Hornsby song. Anyone know the name? ||| Lebron needs to watch this could maybe enhance his leadership skills ||| God I miss this team.

My nigga KB the greatest to ever walk ||| I could watch this all day long, such a legend. ||| 24:13 techs for that? lmfao wow ||| i hate when people compared LeBron James to Kobe Bryant. kobe is a the greatest player ever play this game after Michael Jordan..... ||| I wish Kobe dropped like 40 or 50 this game an it was a close game ||| Can’t believe this is free ||| ultimate competitor ||| can someone tell me which game is this ?  couldnt  find it . ||| 21:25-21:31 you see them soccer skills tho ||| How did they get kobe wired? Where's teh mic? ||| People always say that Kobe DOESN'T make his teammates better.... but just ask yourself -- Farmar, Vujacic, Turiaf, Shannon Brown, Ariza... these were the players around him when he won back-to-back titles. I know he had Gasol and Odom, who are good players, but it really was ALL about getting these role-players to play their best to when those rings. And to add to it -- the 3 years he went to the finals back then, the West had 22 combined 50-win teams over that stretch. I just don't see what all the Kobe haters see with him. He was a great leader, and he really did get those guys to play their best, and he has 2 rings to prove it. ||| I remember this ||| I'm so glad this documentary was able to be made before Phil left. ||| This is one of my favorite documentaries. I took Kobe's knowledge and used it towards business! ||| Timeless insight marvelous era of basketball headlined by Celtics. Lakers. natural phenoms, Prodigy, Dominance with no balance to either side. The greats making the most out of their time to shine as others were prowling to wrap their hands around the NBA for years to come and the most intense characters spearheading their teams through the wars truly great times. ||| So did Kobe coach this team or did Phil? Because Phil barely says anything the entire game. Or is Kobe playing up for the cameras in his face? ||| Damn Kobe made the game look so easy ||| These teams were so freaking good man. I always forget about it, and then I watch this and am just left amazed. ||| Back when basket players believed the earth is round. ||| Fuck Spike Lee ||| its cool how he knows everybody's shooting percentage and plays by that knowledge ||| This was Kobe at his best ||| I can't. ||| 2:25 Little did we know....8 years later ||| great teammate so sad that he retired ||| great basketball IQ ||| Kobe is The best one on one player ever respect to the black mamba from a lakers fan kobe fan and a guy named kobe ||| I love how Kobe gives props to every player and points out what they're good at. ""Duncan's the best PW ever"", ""Bowen's a great corner shooter"", ""Kurt Thomas is one of those 90's Veterans, he'll bang you down low. Those vets are CRAFTY"". Brilliant Basketball IQ Kobe Bryant has always had. Not only preps himself but establishes every opponent's strengths and weaknesses and plays chess until the end of the 4th Qtr. ||| Can't believe how April 13th is so significant in his career! ||| Did anyone peep some of the music is from Nba 2k16 in mycareer ||| Kobe is a mastermine of the game ||| kobe - "" Rub his ass"" I'm in tears ||| Who's here after Kobe's retirement and final performance? ||| Any ||| I remember watching this in 2009. My respect for Kobe increased ten-fold that day, watching Kobe analyze game tape really opened my eyes. A true student of the game, a champion, and all-time great player.

Congrats on a great career and you'll be missed. Respect from a Celtics fan. ||| i dunno what it  is. he had nobody in his prime. He played his best ball, and got jack shit.

he had a lot of turnovers after that (missed shots what do you think of that kobe), but won 2 of 3 more championships.
he's had a weird career ||| Getting a look at the inside the mind of a warrior like Kobe Bryant and how he communicates with his team is so goddamn interesting. Really cool documentary, they should do stuff like this more often. ||| kobe is the greatest of all time ||| This is the year this squad went on to beat my Orlando Magic...R.I.P ||| I don't like Kobe I like Stephen curry ||| 29:02 is hilarious.....""B.Shaw....Lets gooooooooooooo"" LOL...... ||| where is ginobli? ||| Both Spike and Kobe are egotistical a-holes, who for some reason don't understand why they're so overrated. Sure, Kobe got a couple rings with Shaq, but look what he's brought the Lakers to now. ||| Nike must the maind investment of this firm ||| Spike is so true to himself...He's on the Lakers' court wearing Knicks' colors, hahahaha. I respect it! ||| GOTCHA 22:43 ||| this is gold, man!!!! ||| i bet bryon scott never had this kind of film session. ||| This was a great Laker team. A great 3 year stretch! Shame they lost in 08, but observing these guys I couldn't help but compare certain players to the players of the 96 Bulls. Lamar Odom was Toni Kukoc, but a better rebounder and defender. Derek Fisher, Pau, and Trevor Ariza were a hybrid Scottie Pippen. DFish as the compadre to Kobe, Pau with being the number two guy, and Trevor Ariza's body type, athleticism, and height were comparable to Pip's game. Sasha Vujacic a la Steve Kerr. ||| Conceptually, this reminds me of a documentary made in 2006 about soccer legend Zinedine Zidane. It was really interesting as well from the ""portrait of an athletic artist doing what he does"" standpoint, but that said (and love Zizou as I do) this is a whole different level of captivating. 

The insight the voice over & the in-game commentary (from the court as well as the sideline) give into Kobe's analysis of the game is Absolutely Amazing. (I really like basketball, but I don't ""know"" basketball, you know? So this element of the movie is freakin' awesome to me.)   

That coupled with Spike Lee's exceptional photography of the subject at hand...come on, man. This is just beautiful. 

I love this movie, as a fan of basketball and a fan of cinema. ||| GOAT! ||| this is like getting a courtside ticket and watching live ||| So will he be an analyst or a coach when he retires?  If he doesn't use this knowledge and love of the game for something after his body gives up on him I'd be surprised. ||| It's cool to see fans of other teams can appreciate the rivalries. Not only that but appreciate Kobe Bryant rather than hate on him. ||| this is great to see, should do this commentary for more players! ||| really miss these lakers guys, Kobe is the only one still in lakers ||| phil jackson has got some big ass broad shoulders.. ||| I wish Kobe was ten yrs younger ||| 27:58 nice D walton... ||| say what you want about Kobe he really was playing great team ball in this game ||| man i love kobe ||| gonna miss playing this young kobe against the spurs it was such a fun rivalry! Much respect to this man, and this is coming from a spurs fan. ||| Kobe for sure is the best player of the 2000s and one of the best ever. He hasn't got any weakness in his game, but he sometimes lacks as a teamplayer. ||| Great documentary. ||| chris smoove brought me here ||| Beast ||| They should have done this for Game 7 of the 2010 Finals! ||| ""You gon' play till you about 50?"" Lmaooo ||| I hope Spike makes another with Steph Curry or KD. ||| Yeah I know I  ||| Wish they did this with Jordan. That would be amazing ||| Kobe seem to enjoy and clever play!! Then,he talks wel. lol ||| every players have their way of doing things, that's how I see it. ||| My bday is April 13 ||| 65 jelaous lebron james fans ||| Wow this really opened my eyes to Kobe.I didn't realize he was as humble towards the opposing players. ||| All Hail The King 
6:55 16:55 <-- execution is what matters 
20:20 <-- with all the game footage players watch you don't think they know what the plays are? Of course they do but players still call plays in front of the defense all the time cause it doesn't change anything. Basketball plays don't work based on the element of surprise.
27:25 <-- watch & learn ||| Been playing basketball all my life, but that was a lot less interesting than I thought it'd be. Thumbs up for sharing though. ",0.0845653343360754,0.9845882058143616,8,1,0.08,100

Its sick, inhumane at sometimes. People just need to learn that selling your life for easy money is not the way to go. sure i have no education except for a highschool diploma but hell i still look up and i imagine myself under a roof of my own. People can be better. they just need to work on themselves. that boy Mister, he did everything that he could do and i am proud of him. ||| Best movie ive seen in a while.

-_GPiwqmUiA,Ghostbusters II (1989),Taken straight from the newly-released 4K remaster blu-ray,movie,544663.0,1786.0,158,PT2M33S,"In theaters with Dead Poets Society and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Field of Dreams ||| How could those kids ever think the Ghostbusters were full of crap as if they didn't blow up a 100 foot tall walking marshmallow just a few years prior? ||| The 1984 film was a 10/10 classic!  As for this 2nd 1989 one? If someone were to ask if they needed to see it, my response would be: ""Well, you can.""  5/10  My opinion is that you wouldn't get angry, insulted, or demand your 2 hours back.  But you will not walk away with the same feeling you had with the 1984 ORIGINAL  or AFTERLIFE (2021) . ||| I've seen a trailer like this labeled international, but this looks like a redo without certain cutscenes used only in the trailers and recut with scenes from the finished movie. ||| Nothing to do with titanic but it is kinda cool ||| 0:36 I WILL HAVE YOU BAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNEEEED AT THE STAKE!!!!!! ||| 0:12 that is a young Jason Reitman. The director Ghostbusters: Afterlife. His sister's in the film too... she's the little girl with the puppy. ||| Bustin makes me feel good ||| Fun Fact Jason Reitman Was A Director Of Ghostbusters Afterlife I've Hope Will Add It In the Upcoming Ghostbusters Ultimate Collection ||| Fans: Get me the Ghostbusters.
Writers of Afterlife: YOU GOT 'EM. ||| GH🚫STBUSTERS✌ ||| We Got The Second trailer For Ghostbusters II ||| The first shot looks more 2016 quality than the 2016 movie ||| Outstanding trailer and movie 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 horror ||| Not as good as the first, still better than around 95% of pop culture of the past 20 years! ||| winston is so hardcore 😎🤜🏻🤛🏻 ||| This movie was the shit when i was a kid. ||| In my opinion way better tjan the first one i know alot of people were dissapointed with Ghostbusters 2 but i love it my favourite film of all time ||| Face it Ghostbusters didn't exist ||| It would of been better if the media weren't snowflakes and the 2016 all female film didn't exist ||| 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 
 I absolutely love this movie. 
 1:41 💕❤ 
  👇👇👇❤ ||| 🔥🔥🔥 
 Opened many minds tonight 
 1:34 💗🎥🎬 
   👇 👇 👇 👇💚 ||| 1:56 my favorite line from the sequel! ||| It is slime time!!!!! ||| You know what back in 2005 why not Director name Tim Burton should made Ghostbusters movie call’ed Ghostbusters 3 The Wrath of Cthulhu With the same old actors like Bill Murray Dan Aykroyd Sigourney Weaver Harold Ramis (before he passed away) Ernie Hudson Annie Potts and even some younger teen actors like Munro Chambers as Oscar Christa B. Allen as Lisa Michael B Jordan as Max Lyndsy Fonseca as Susie and Johnny Depp as the evil villain (who worship Cthulhu as a god) so that way Tim Burton will Focus on Series roots on The same Story to Ivan Reitman’s Ghostbusters Movies but Ivan Reitman will be a Producer along with Director name Tim Burton will Direct another Sequel called Ghostbusters 3 The Wrath Of Cthulhu but it will came out in Summer 2005 not that stupid remake called Charlie and the chocolate factory!!!!! ||| I love it ||| Movie is very spotty.  The court room scenes were great.  There's some good dialogue throughout.  But overall, eh. ||| 2020 ||| Hey Andy , this is the best footage ever that I have ever watched in you tube, it is perfect ,better than the footage of 2018 films ||| They say you are a frog.
Peter: I am a frog

Winston: face it Ghostbusters didn't exist ||| I loved Ghostbusters 2 it was really fun ||| It took 5 years 2 do a sequel and 2 decades 2 do a reboot ||| My biggest complaint of this movie is Murray. Don't get me wrong, he was a lot of fun to watch but you can tell he looked a little annoyed to be in it. The same energy from the first was missing and it seemed the comedy misfired more than it should. Again don't get me wrong, I love this movie. I would rate it 75%, much higher than what i has from RT, but it does have flaws. ||| The opening of the trailer basically describes ghostbusters 2016 to critics ||| 2:17 Sure this one sucked, but a truer line has never been spoken... right, Sony? ||| Thanks to the 2016 movie, Ghostbusters 2 is not longer the worst entry. ||| Ghostbusters 2 funny and still worth watching I wish they did Ghostbusters 3 ||| I love it ||| This is so cool ||| This movie is the same as the first BUT BAD! ||| never realized this....but the formula is......sctv meets snl meets in living colour...........wish they had keenan ivory waynes instead ||| i got to say the old ghost busters are realistic and the new one looks fake ||| In that scene where the guys are running through that crowd, a lady who in the future would be in my bowling league got whacked by Venkman's proton pack. ||| A lot of these scenes, were actually taken out of the first and 2nd trailers (this one) like Ray telling the mayor that ""if nothing is done, by midnight, New York is going to be sucked into the tenth level of hell"" and others were recut for different scenes like the glass scene were recut for the montage after the court scene. ||| Shame the sound hasn't been restored. ||| 1:47 - 1:55 :) ||| My band just released a rock cover of the Ghostbusters theme for Halloween! Enjoy! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Os784AONv5M&rdm=29xz4o1y6&client=mv-google ||| so i waited 5 years for ghost busters 3 and we got female version.....so ||| ahhhh the old times ||| one of my favourite films just pure magic never gets old ||| That Harold Ramis was one fine piece of ass. Why wasn't I a grown adult instead a pissing kid? ||| This is how they should make movies now a days ||| What does he mean he was boarder line for a while I don't get that line ||| Fucking classic. Screw anyone who thinks different ||| I like all three films (including the reboot) fine....*waits for ghostbros to piss their vintage Ghostbusters underwear* ||| I like the 1st one better ||| WHO THE FRICK WOULD DISLIKE THIS!!!!!!!! ||| I thought ghost busters are girls ||| I've watched these two movies so many times in a short period of time, I'm starting to know the lines by heart xD ||| Not Better Than The Original But Better Than The Reboot ||| idea is the blob?? ||| God, I love this movie! ||| I effin love the 2nd one lol and to think the critics hated it back then. ||| better than new Ghostbusters 2016 ||| At the time of release this sequel was snubbed by critics, but today, compare to the 2016 shit, is a masterpiece!! ||| We eat gods for breakfast! - Egon ||| I remember seeing this in the theater with my folks as a ten year-old. ||| Much better than that new female version of the ghostbusters, people have truly running out of fresh ideas and are starting to ruin classic favourites ||| Nothing supernatural there lol, 
Great film though ||| Attack of the mutated pink bubble gum and some grumpy guy from a giant painting ||| they only made two ghostbusters and both were great so it was a perfect franchise that wasn't ruined by a terrible 3rd installment, ........UNTIL NOW 2016!! ||| says "" the titanic just arrived""
Me: I'll get jack you go get Rose ||| The new Ghostbusters2 board game trailer featuring Ernie Hudson is awesome haha https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cze/ghostbusters-the-board-game-ii/description ||| Wow they showed everything in the trailers back then. ||| ""...and Ivan Reitman!""
(Picture of Slimer) ||| This movie is a zillion times better than that new lesbian Ghostbusters that will be coming out in July. ||| Ernie Hudson shaves his moustache and he becomes almost unrecognisable ||| Titanic ||| ""They think you are a fraud.""

-I'am a fraud ||| Good old-fashioned normal Ghostbusters ||| At the end of the trailer they said, ""we are the only ghostbusters"" and they are damn right ||| Ok this is a little better than the first one...trailer wise... ||| People bag on the new trailer for the third movie as uninspiring.  However, both this trailer, and the trailer from the original release were HORRIBLE.  The latter, for what was actually a really great movie.  We'll see what happens with the new story later this year. ||| Love this trailer! :D ||| they lied about the world ending today. it wasn't as good as the first movie yet this is the last well see classic gb and the animated real series. screw the reboot with women and men. ||| I know everyone was disappointed with Ghostbusters II and it has a reputation for being a flop, but I loved it. It may not be as good as the first film, but I think it's a decent sequel, every bit as funny, has a great soundtrack, great special effects, and in some ways it is even better than the first. Here are 10 things I prefer more about Ghostbusters II:

1. It's a little more fast-paced than the first film.

2. The movie is more light-hearted: still scary, but never becoming as dark and horrific as the first film does in places. It feels more like a fun family movie (which I like).

3. There's more variety, more happening, more set pieces.

4. There are more actual ghosts (the see-through kind) like the Scoleri Brothers, Jogger, Titanic, etc.

5. I like the styling of the film more, it's less gritty and a touch more polished, drawing inspiration from the cartoon.

6. I like that Winston is in this one from the start. It's no longer an origin story, it is a fullly-fledged Ghostbusters adventure.

7. Louis is much better in this film. He's no longer just a pathetic loser and now much more of a fully-formed comedy character.

8. Janine's look is way better in this film! She went from being plain, dowdy and middle-aged, to sexy and beautiful (again they drew inspiration from the cartoon which was a good move).

9. I actually think all the characters are better developed and more firmly established in the second film.

10. The first film is really lacking a villain (Gozer only makes a brief appearance near the end). But Ghostbusters II had a real, solid villain: Vigo was great, and scary! Plus Janosz as the creepy accomplice. Just great! :)

There is actually only one thing I really don't like about Ghostbusters II, and that is the stuff about the ghosts stealing Oscar. Putting a baby in the middle of a scary scene undermines the drama (babies are cute and they can't ""act scared""). It also makes you feel uncomfortable for the baby. Babies just should not be in scary scenes and it doesn't sit well with me. I would much rather Janosz had been given a mission to seduce Dana, rather than snatch her baby. If I could edit out the baby-snatching stuff I would enjoy this movie a lot more.

I also think the final battle with Vigo is a little disappointing. The scene is quite ""small"" in scale and they basically just shoot him. I would have liked more from the scene; something clever; some kind of surprise or change: something memorable; something big. There's no ""Marshmallow Man"" moment. The Statue of Liberty is a great sequence and had massive potential, but it's all pre-planned by the Ghostbusters, so there is no drama or surprise to it. They basically just hitch a ride on it and don't really use it against Vigo.

I would have preferred it if Gozer himself had grown giant, towering over the Ghostbusters and terrifying the crowds below--and *then* they decide to go get the Statue of Liberty, and fight Vigo in the streets from the statue, with all the crowd cheering. I think that would have put the Statue of Liberty to good use, and it would have given this great film a truly epic ending, making it more memorable and earning it more widespread popularity. ||| Showed the whole movie ||| Wow,  this was pretty good trailer, felt a lot like today's trailer. Would get me pumped if like Ghostbusters was in 2014 and then this was the trailer for the sequel in 2019. ||| This is the best trailer for this movie. ||| Love this trailer, thank you.  ||| Nice.

Disturbing Behavior Trailer - Steve (James Marsden) and his family move to a small town where all its teenage inhabitants are brainwashed and insane.

MGM - 1998",movie,128095.0,506.0,110,PT2M29S,"❤❤ ||| My favorite movie when I was a teenager ❤ ||| Everyone this is free on tubi tv ||| Seeing that last shot where she headbutts the mirror - I swear I remember being in the theatre when this trailer played and hearing the whole audience just bust up laughing. ||| The way the boys wore from the 50s ||| Love this film ||| Is it a deleted scene at 1:33 ? Because I don't remember a love scene with Katie Holmes ||| Potential competitors. ||| Wow the writers know how schools are now so well before it happened. This exactly what is happening now. ||| This movie deserved better. ||| Not Hindi dubbed 🙄🙄🙄 blockbuster trailer 🙄🙄 ||| Under distributed by Village Roadshow - Hoyts Film Partnership and Columbia Tristar Film Distributors International (now Sony Pictures Releasing International). On behalf of Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios. ||| It's almost like watch today's celebrities glitch out when they're on camera. Could be a link or MK ultra ||| Peep Show's theme song brought me here ||| VACCINES 💉 ||| Could Hollywood make a remake of Disturbing Behavior? 🥰 ||| I would really love to see a remake of Disturbing Behavior 💖❤️ ||| “SCIENCE IS GOD.” 
-Anthony Fauci ||| Do itttt! ||| And then... Katie Holmes grew up and married Tom cruise and joined the cult of Scientology. Mind control for sure. Glad she got out but just saying.... the truth is stranger than fiction! ||| I've seen that movie since yesterday ||| 🔥🔥 
 MUST-MUST-MUST-MUST see 
 1:19 💓💟💯 
  👇💙 ||| Who's in their 40s in 2019 feeling nostalgic 💕 ||| I can see the CW turning this into a TV show ||| Underrated thriller. ||| favorite part in this film:
""whoa! Not so fast! What's the capital of North Dakota?""
Steve: ""How the f*ck should I know?!""
lmao ||| 1:29 God, she was gorgeous! 😌 💔 ||| Watches this last night on Amazon. Memories ;) .... ||| Alright.  ""I Was a Teenage Stepford."" ||| Harvey Danger! ||| Where's Cyclops when you need him ||| cyclops should have optic blasted em ||| +spider man What I meant 2 say was after the ending credits. ||| My favorite quote ""Hey Teacher Leave These Kids Alone"" ||| I remember going to the theater to see this movie. Now Every time I see James Marsden in a movie I will always remember him as Steve Clark. When I saw him in X-men as  Cyclopes I went ""He was in Disturbing behavior!"" Like when Toby Maguri playing Spiderman he was In ""Fear And Loathing"" (and Gavin played John Conner) ||| This movie made no sense. Watch the Faculty instead, similar type of story but better. ||| Wow. Way to go giving away some of the best plot twists of the movie.
Who the fuck would do that?? 
This was a good ""horror"" flick, but they should've made the trailer better than this. ||| This was the movie that made me have the biggest Hollywood crush on Katie Holmes. 
What a *FOX* she was in this! Especially that part when Steve first spots her in the back of the pick-up. Hot damn. ||| GOT YOU WHERE I WANT YOU!! ||| **SOUNDS FAMILIAR..LOL** ||| Including Night Of The Living Dead 1968, & Assault On Precinct 13 1976. ||| Also references 2 Aliens 1986. ||| ""The Stepford Wives"" in high school! ||| This movie, she's all that, the faculty, can't hardly wait, drive me crazy... I can go on and on. These late 90's teen movies remind me of my teenage years also. ||| Cook's Ridge Trash is trash you want to take out. ||| This is kind of mix of Low-Budget & A Million Dollar Budget Film. ||| After the ending credits or post credits they should have shown the after math of what happened. ||| In 2004 some of the reference they kind of put it in Alien Vs Predator & Aliens Vs Predator Requiem. ||| The Scene in 2:06 isn't featured in the movie at all. ||| They should have @ least put some references from Alien 1979, Carnosaur, Carnosaur 2, Mosquito 1995, Carnosaur 3: Primal Spieces. To give it some Thriller & Adventure included into this film. ||| Did I see a couple of deleted scenes? ||| find it funny that Kathrine Isabelle and the jock that was after Rachel . was both on the show supernatural ||| a sequel for this film should be made ||| That narrator -trailer -90s -voice gives me crazy throwback.

But I was stationary and couldn’t go anywhere.  I was born with Moebius Syndrome so I have clubbed feet.  But I made it to the floating divider.  I clung to it and climbed my way back to the shallow end while avoiding swimmers on the other side.  When I made it back, the lifeguard asked me if I was okay.  I said “Yeah, I’m fine!”  Then I put the barbells on the side of the pool.  I grabbed the barbells again later on, held them close to my chest, and tried swimming again in the shallow end.  I was stationary.  So now I know not to do that.  I wonder if someone filmed my ordeal. ||| The funniest part is that some of these people were competitive swimmers and divers 😂 ||| Some of these fails looked very painful 😮 ||| 0:33 W ||| Avevo paura fossero finiti gli imbecilli… ||| Can not imagine the world without fools😂😂😂 ||| As someone who is going to the pool tomorrow, i’m hoping i don’t end up like the people in this video. ||| Умничка моя👧 добрая хорошая любимая маленькая ласковая заботливая нежная маленькая👧 девочка моя👧.!!!

HEFCN4qaYt4,Only God Forgives (2013),New trailer for Nicolas Winding Refns ONLY GOD FORGIVES. The film has its premiere in Cannes Main Competition 2013.,movie,1574974.0,3675.0,830,PT1M22S,"either people love this movie or despise it is what i’m getting from this comment section ||| this movie was so fukin weird. people starring into nothingness  like its the new thing or something, @ first it was funny, then it got awkward and ridiculous 

the main character makes good movies, but this one was fucking garbage. ||| this is pure art ||| Most artistic movie i'v ever seen. ||| So much anger when a simple ""no"" would do. You went from all this God talk to a character study now. So you're saying there's no message whatsoever, no moral to the story? The title doesn't mean anything either right? ||| If what you say is true then you are a total scumbag..you must live a sad life. ||| It is, and he is. ||| Well this film is nothing like that. ||| You mean movies where the white man kills a bunch of Asian dudes?  Hollywood gets at least 8 of those every year. ||| We don't get many films like this. I don't know about everyone else, but I enjoyed it. ||| spoiler alert he dies ||| I have watch this Film in Bangkok , i was there for vacation and my Thai gf invited me to watch the film, it's not bad not too much talk in it it's an average film , too much violence in it. Thai and American mix style. ||| How?  ||| i realy loved it. so what if theres no dialogue! are people so set in their ways and brainwashed that films all have to be the same. does the plot and meaning have to be spelt out to you while the director holds your hand? I read mixed reviews but was realy impressed. its unique and how many films are that these days? I found it gripping and wasnt bored at all. i realy dont understand people not liking it. i think it will be a cult movie at least ||| -Top 3 favorite directors are Kubrick, Lynch and PTA, respectively
-Went to a Film School
-Read ""Shot by Shot"" by Steven Katz

I won the game. ||| you're insane and stupid ||| Which makes it better. Silence and violence > Spoken language ||| cinematography is fantastic, but...theres maybe 5 lines in the entire film..... ||| That's an opinion. ||| So by making this film, the filmmakers are trying to preach their personal supernatural beliefs to the audience all along, huh, who knew?  ||| Story was a simple one turned into a great plot. ||| Try to be more open minded next time ||| I think she had sex with her mother,how she knew the size of his dick?? she said ""I have a special relationship with him"" ||| did not developed the story that good,had the potential to be a great story but it was not,it needed more twists,intrigue ,OGF has great cinematography,soundtrack and acting,the thai cop was really good. ||| but the womb bit i didnt pick up on - a fair point but very very odd. ||| actually your interpretation is very similar to what I thought after the film ....the problem was it didnt come together in the film for me. Yes I saw the connections after but it didnt hold me as his other films did ...it felt weak despite the ideas and the imagery. ||| fair enough. yes its an opinion but an opinion held by everyone I know who loves Refn and his films. Also I havent heard one explanation as to why OGF is so good other than people who dont know shit about films (im not including you in this) saying that it is ""violent, cool and different"" = not giving any reason what they got from the film, what they liked about it etc  ||| also while were at it - please explain the deepness and metaphorical nature of OGF - maybe ill understand it better....im happy to be proved wrong. ||| also I didn't find OGF unsettling at all unlike other Refn films it was at points laughable or just plain boring - and those are words I would never think I would be using to describe a Refn film. He tried to impersonate his hero Alejandro Jodorowsky in the film's abstractness but it went too far.

Also the reason Im annoyed is that 90% of the fan boys who claim OGF is refn's best film have only seen Drive (and they probably liked it because it had a ""cool soundtrack and awesome violence"") ||| bullshit, Drive had incredible core and soul to it, as did Valhalla and Bronson was more of a character study. 

Secondly i said the film had no character - I DID NOT say that their was ""no character development"" i already know about refn and his style of characters.

So all the characters in Drive, bronson are metaphors ? bullshit 

One Eye in Valhalla Rising is a metaphor but it worked. 

Vithaya Pansringarm is supposed to be God in this movie I understand that but it just doesnt work.
 ||| Everything. Well I give both films a 10/10, but if I have to choose one, it would be Only God Forgives. ||| oh dear dear dear ....please explain how this is better than Drive ? It is by far Refn's worst film. ||| And my 3 friends who all loved Drive and Bronson (i dont think theyve seen valhalla or pusher trilogy) watched it with me and were disappointed. ||| Sorry this film was poor and this is coming from a huge Refn fan. 

Pusher Trilogy, Bronson, Valhalla Rising, Drive - all different but all very good interesting films. 

Only God Forgives is the prime example of a great director going overboard, it happens to most good directors that they do one shit or average film now and then. 

Visually the film was still great but it had no soul and character whatsoever. 

And anyone who says this is better than Drive doesn't know shit about films.
 ||| IMO this had a better and more intriguing story than Drive.  ||| This literally shows ask the action parts in the movie. ||| no way,drive was much better,OGF has great cinematography,soundtrack  and acting ,but the story was not so good,needed a better story,still not a bad movie at all ,like most critics said. ||| lets have a vote! Thumbs up if you think Drive is better than Only God Forgive ?  ||| Bro its an art film the director even said he knows this movie doesnt have any elements of a blockbuster everyone goes to watch  ||| Whats this song?
 ||| No, I don't live in Africa. ||| If you knew anything about the director's style you would not of been expecting another Drive. ||| drive sucked ||| Don't go in expecting ANYTHING new or interesting. The movie lacks motivation, Ryan Gosling's a robot, and you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy more than the good guy. The movie will leave your memory as quickly as it entered. ||| You remember the seen where he drags that one thug by the mouth? If you can tell me either what his name was, why he was there, where was he, or why was ryan gosling's character there then I'll let you have this one. All you have to do is answer one. After all, if the movie is so great than it should have done a great job explaining everything to you right? ||| This ""pile of shit"" is one of the greatest things I've ever experienced. This had more character development than Drive.  ||| Bullshit. Drive at least had some fucking character development. This movie was the biggest pile of shit to be released in theaters since Battlefield Earth. ||| Never been so bored in my life. It seems that Ryan feels he doesn't have to act anymore and just stand there looking all moody... terrible film, I'm disappointed. ||| Congratulations Nicolas Winding Refn, on creating a film that actually requires people to engage themselves, instead of churning out a film which force feeds its story to the viewer. Great movie. ||| well the movie description said ""violence and sex"",it should only said instead ""violence"" because there is hardly any sex .  ||| That's your first Mistake, don't call drive a flick, Drive was a masterpiece!  ||| You have to know what your watching this movie was 100 times better than drive no question about it  ||| Well if you go into it expecting a hot nude chick, you will prob be let down, Drive never had any nudity per say.. But check out the ChrisStuckmann YT vid explaining this movie, it will all come together then, and it makes me want to see it again. ||| Saw it today,great cinematography ,soundtrack and acting,that thai cop was really good,but the story was not that good,and some parts were too slow,it was not that violent as many people said,maybe because I have seen so many violent movies that I don't get impressed so easy,not a bad movie at all,but had the potential to be better ,also I was expecting some hot sex scene or naked hot thai slut,or naked MILF kristin scott,maybe I should have waited for the dvd,but I kind of like it anyway. ||| I like different kind of movies,I may watch this one. ||| Well if you haven`t scene it yet, it`s a very different movie than Drive but also with an amazing soundtrack and visuals. It`s very violent and stark, and also very slow at some scenes, but I was never bored. It may be confusing during some artistic scenes, but if you watch the ChrisStuckmann YT vid on the explaination (after viewing it), you will find yourself wanting to see it again! Let me know what u think! ||| I believe I`ve answered all you`re questions, and tried to explain to you a movie which you don`t clearly get. I don`t have word ""wars"" I have calm discussions, I save the wars for Jiu-Jitsu class. ||| I like this movie; it's unorthodox and really artistic. Just because critics don't praise it, doesn't mean it's terrible. Give it a chance. ||| Movie is ok i like how unpredictable it is, overall its not as good as hyped and ratings say so as well, 90% is about the cinematography, actual filming technique, and the overall aura of the underground Bangkok world. U do need to have a higher level of attention and love for filmography. It was shot 100% the same as a psychological thriller. Most people like action, action, action They made a terrible mistake by associating the movie and trailers to a crime drama and thats what people expected ||| If you like the movie, then it's good. Couldn't care less what some self-proclaimed newspaper movie guru thinks about it. ||| It's very brooding, stylized, and excessively violent.  It reminds me of Apocalypse Now with the atmosphere, exotic locale and emotion.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Won't blow your mind.  But it deserves credit for going off the beaten path from not being too formulaic or cliche.  I respect it as a movie made as actual cinematic art.  Not another big budget moving whoring out to the lowest common denominator for ticket sales.  ||| good as drive? ||| many critics said it sucks ||| I'd continue this war of word with you, but you're obviously unarmed. Good day.  ||| If you'd bother to watch the ChrisStuckmann video on this you would understand the crotch scene is completely relevant to the films story.. Badlands is actually my favourite movie, if you're familiar with Malick's work. I don't normally feel I can have intellectual debates with people who use ""LOL"" in every second sentence. Cheers. ||| Artistic intelligent? LOL! Yeah, cause it's so artistic to have a crotch shot that's irrelevant to the story. The movie lacks substance yet there's intelligence? LOL!!! You're such an idiot. Why don't you watch a Terrence Malick film and maybe you'll gain an understanding of what an artistically intelligent film is suppose to be. But since you know everything about films, I guess all the critics out there are wrong. They're all so dumb for not seeing the ""artistic intelligent"" in this film. LOL ||| ""close ups of his fists and crotch for no reason"" Hmm I see, you don't get the key elements of this movie, you should watch the ChrisStuckmann video explaining it. ""imbecile, moron"" for someone to insult a stranger online, rather than chat intelligently, you must be an unstable, volatile person, with short attention span, so yes please stay away from artistic intelligent movies like this.  ||| One the slickest films ever put together!!! ||| oh look it's in Thailand. =] ||| I'm an indie fan you imbecile. I don't even watch big budget movies. He's not prominent in the movie? Are you fuckin stupid? He's the main character you moron! This movie was pretentious and made out of ego by the director. Close up shot of his crotch. Close up shot of fist just clenching for no reason. The only art in this movie is the cinematography.  ||| Amazing movie! I love that people hate this! points out all the braindead inartistic idiots! I was never bored during this. ||| I'm sorry you don't get this movie, but maybe you think everyday life should be like a Michael Bay movie? Well it isn't and this movie had great substance and story line, plus climax.
Gosling does not stand around trying to look cool, he's actually not even that prominent in this movie. ||| solarmovie
 ||| It's only in limited release.

BUT... it's available for purchase on digital rental from iTunes, Amazon, etc. ||| Cliff Martinez - Wanna Fight ||| Gosling is too attractive to play Max Payne, but I like your idea of Refn doing it. ||| can anyone tell me what the name of the song is that start at 0:28 ? ||| -_- ||| that aint a website ||| good reliable website to watch this?  ||| If you want to watch Ryan Gosling modeling and trying to look cool for an hour and a half, then this is your movie. He just stands around and has literally less than 20 lines in the whole movie.  ||| Like Ryan Gosling?
Please check our channel for “condensed” versions/alternate trailers of RG’s brilliant films: “All Good Things”, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"", “Blue Valentine”, ""Drive"", “The Notebook”, “Gangster Squad” and ""Half Nelson"" as well as other cool stuff....Thanks!
 ||| I just watched the movies 2 day ago in Bangkok, at first the movie was interested but what's a purpose this movie??? i only see them make people think bad about Bangkok and scared, and what a terrible in the end of movie, I was disappointed, awful! ||| This was better than Drive. ||| It's actually Wanna Fight by Cliff Martinez, it sounds similar to 1986. ||| It was really really slow in the theaters, but after discussing interpretations with friends and reading analyses online about WTF I just saw, I gotta say this movie was pretty damn good.  ||| I was disappointed  ||| dont overlook this movie  ||| Not cause he is attractive. He just appears soft in the face. I personally couldn't take him serious as max payne. But then again, I don't really have a preference for who should play Max. I'm thinking the guy who played The Punisher in the 1st one. Or the other guy who played the punisher: war zone. ||| not bad altogether but could've been MUCH better...the plot line is one of the thinnest I've ever witnessed ||| What is the song that is playing?

What has happened with this young Perry director? I expected more from him. ||| I watched this 11 years ago wooooww ||| Cowboys and Aliens the prequel. ||| Clancy!! ||| Mana full movisnya ||| killer gophers? ||| Thought it was pretty average tbh ||| they poison you so you're paralyzed , drag you off and bury you while you're still alive , then when you're rotting come to feast ||| Great movie.  Hard/ painful to watch - the racism.  In the realm of ""Cloverdale"", ""Predator"" (as mentioned in other reviews).  Lots of good edge of your seat thrills.  The ""Borrowers"" themselves looked pretty trippy - the legs.. Good special effects.  Good acting. Wanted the Military guy to get his just desserts. Good to see real Native actors used. Sound track was good also. Painful to watch, but true to the historical attitudes.....historical? Just last month, 1/29/15 Native children were harassed and spit on by white hockey fans during a game in Rapid City.. I guess It's not just historical attitudes. Home grown Terrorists.   Like the people who see the 1st Nation people as the antagonists when they defend their land.  Who did she say killed all the Buffalo?   Who shot first in the woods?  Who tortured the 'Human Being' when they assumed it was them that killed the family?  ||| The subtle ""Predator"" noises were a nice twist. haha ||| You forgot to mention aliens didn't exist ||| Those are some vicious prairie dogs ||| LOVE THIS MOVIE!! ||| not that bad actually.. cool plot ||| ok lol ||| .....Sigh ||| no it was jus a sign of the times ||| kewl ||| It seems to have this message about the treatment of the blacks and Indians I believe it was trying to show the brutishness of the U S Calvary. ||| Agreed alot better than I thought had a great atmosphere  ||| I agree.... what is with all the idiotic comments that have nothing to do with the trailer. just a bunch of girl bickering back and forth! BTW this movie was very good for low budget even go watch it! ||| red dead redemption undead nightmare  
 ||| lol! I have not thought of that name in a year.  hah! ||| is this film freaky- will it keep me up tonight? ||| That pissed me off too.. ||| oh, okay.. thanks! finally. hahaha  ||| nah, just chillin :) ||| what do you mean Diablo is bad game or Diablo say that ? ||| This is a good movie, but they could have left the last four minutes out because it doesn't even go with it.
SPOILERS
It seems they used it just to kill of the survivors. When they showed him being rescued and the kid's eye is when it should have ended. IMO, the military man re appearing  out of nowhere to kill everybody made no sense. I mean you have this badass can you stay alive til I get back moment, and not five minutes later, survivors dead. WTF really? ||| I liked this movie quite a lot. cowboys and monsters, woo hoo. ||| This movie was good...In fact it was very good, but something was missing..... ||| you just made yourself one of them ;) haha smart !!  ||| i agree ||| DIABLO... angry son of a bitch ||| whew.. we're cool.... LOL!!!! ||| lighten up G.R. assdragon ||| @Grassdragoon what are you? 70 years old? 90% of the ""shit"" made post year 2,000 is shit? You're an idiot.  ||| @Grassdragoon You sound old. ||| taki film to dno napisany przez psyhopate ||| @mrbishop77 um. I'm not pulling the ""race card"" nor did I say anything remotely racist. I'm not planning on seeing the movie either. I just had a random impulse to comment on the trailer.  ||| @yasashikokoro12345 Actually the Native American's aren't the bad guys.  That is the point.  It shows how blind these people were by their fear and hatred for the NA people.  Eventually they work together to fight the unknown enemy here.  From your comment I am guessing you haven't seen the film. Don't be so hasty to pull the race card on something before you know the full story.  ||| This film is actually Petty good! ||| @yasashikokoro12345, well one last thing, I didn't say YOU were racist, and I'm white too. And the movie is offensive because Native Americans are the antagonists....Well, so by that logic, True Grit is offensive for featuring an antagonist that is implied to be mentally challenged, and Indiana Jones IV is offensive towards Russians. Your logic doesn't hold water. So yeah, I don't mean to rub you the wrong way, just stating the truth. ||| @1Morey um, no actually. It's offensive because they're making the native americans the bad guys. You're the racist one for assuming that I'm racist by default just because I'm white so you can get over YOURSELF. How the hell am I racist when I specifically stated that I'm in a relationship with a native american? LOL. Before jumping to conclusions, maybe you should stop overanalyzing other people's comments. k thanks ;) ||| @yasashikokoro12345, so because a movie has Native Americans in it means it's racist. you need to get over yourself. ||| Did they take a corpse from the middle of nowhere? Someone should put a sing that tells them they are not supposed to do that ! ||| red dead redemption undead nichtmare? ||| @Grassdragoon the thing is, there isn't much room for it to be expensive, it is in the old west.
And CGI and explosions have entertainment value of their own XD ||| @trigunxvash10 lol thanks xD ||| @erpvb it's cuz regular trailers shown to the general public normally has the green background which symbolizes that the preview has been approved to be shown to ALL audiences. red background shows it to be approved for restricted audiences only. yea....even movie trailers have R ratings. lol. ||| Looks good. It reminds me of the Tremors films which I enjoyed. ||| good film, takes a bit of time to get into it, but worth it :D ||| is itt just me or is the red background in that intro new ? ||| @Grassdragoon Like Avatar, The Dark Night, Lord of the Rings, 28 Days Later, Kill Bill, Napoleon Dynamite, Pan's Labyrinth, Slumdog Millionaire, Superbad, Requiem for a Dream, Ju-on, 300, Borat?...etc.... ||| not the kind of movie i would normally go for. movies of this kind usually suck (in my opinion, that is)...so i was quite surprised that i liked it....the only thing that i didn't like was the burrowers dying because of the sunlight... ||| Superb movie; intelligently written, directed and acted to perfection. Because it may considered horror, some may say it is merely good---bullshit, this is a great motion picture, clever and different. ||| This was actually a pretty good movie. Some straight to DVD movies are actually really good, Another straiht to dvd movie i would recommend is Dead Birds.  ||| im white and my boyfriend is native american, this is offensive to me. lol. ||| @Siritia 
   Getting bitten by praire dogs is fun. ||| DAMN!!!! people gettin fukd up in the wild wild west!!!! ||| @locopolk our try stagevu or veehd ||| better than I expected from an american ""horror"" but not good. ||| @CBOfficielCM 
trdbl ||| @CBOfficielCM 
pour toi 1/20 et bouffon ||| @AmorphisKf411 I haven't watched it yet, so thanks for not spoiling it!! ||| @DogAndBroom You're right, this movie isn't Transformers. I was able to sit through this. Michael Bay is such an untalented fuck. I just wanted to throw that out there. Kudos to you, sir. ||| bon film. ||| pas mal du tout comme film note 14/20 ||| Haven't seen it, but I like Western-Horrors as a genre mix.  Just the right amount of weaponary, but primitive enough that  you don't have to first figure out why nobody calls the police on a cellphone and brings in the National Guard. ||| A surprisingly good movie in my opinion. What truly scared me about this film was how the ""Burrowers"" killed their victims...You will know what I mean if you watched the film. ||| the ending creeped me the fuck out. i love it! ||| @Akralaa seriously.  Tremors 2 the graboids evolved to squat little ones with two legs.  And Tremors 4 took place in the wild west.  
 ||| @Akralaa seriously.  Tremors 2 the graboids evolved to squat little ones with two legs.  And Tremors 4 took place in the wild west.   ||| i thought it is just another crappy horror movie but it is definitely worth watching. the fact that the creatures-burrowers are attributed to native american legends makes it much more credible. 
still one thing makes no sense to me,  where in the middle of the prairie do they find wood for all the campfires in the movie?
anyhow, very recommendable movie ||| @Grassdragoon fuck yeah, like The Warriors ||| @Grassdragoon  I agree!!! ||| @KrazyCitten And there's Kelvin, too! ||| I liked it. 

The performances were way above average by horror genre standards and the atmosphere was creepy throughout the whole film. 

Not nearly as gruesome as I heard btw. ||| @DeathPenguin1000 Indeed it was, I watched it this morning ||| This movie was really good actually ||| @Avankiri ............. ||| Can you say ""Tremors""? ||| One of the great modern horror movies. It combines great characterizations, great story line, great direction and fine set design to create one of the most exciting and suspenseful motion pictures I have seen in a long time. I love good horror films, but this movie transcends even horror; it just is a movie you should see. And I am NOT the director's father or brother! See it! Dudes! ||| they are fuckin mole men... ||| 1:49 Congrats, you jerk, you contaminated the crime scene. Also, there's a predator at 1:51 ||| @meanygreene how did you know!? ||| willing to bet the black dude dies ||| @DogAndBroom dude, dont bother with these bitches, they must see blood and gore, and sex and action ... if they dont see that, a movie is not horror ||| I fell asleep half way through the movie so I didn't have to watch it all, a tad too creepy for me personally, my friend said he got nightmares from it. ||| At first I wasnt sure if I was going to like it but then I was like actually this great and its a horror with a story which you dont get much these days
 ||| newer version of Tremors ? ||| @chestbuster1987 1+ haha speedling rush^^ ||| Nice western horror movie! ||| pesadote ||| this movie could've been so good - set the scene nicely, well acted, really good shoot but stupid story and pay-off ||| this movie was pretty good ||| one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. so terrible. ||| don't waste your time with this, I wasted mine ||| this trailer kinda spoils everything, since in the movie, you're not supposed to know what the holes means utill the end, which leads me to my second point: this movie must be the most boring horror movie i have ever seen, a movie where people simply rides around with holes in the ground here and there untill the end of the movie where they just shoots a little anyway isn't realy a good movie to me, also that monster is kind of a vampire rippof in the shape of a cricket ||| it's free on demand right now.

I then check the wikipedia for Pandorum...that if flopped that it got negative reviews and I'm like...... there are some really strange people out there. I've watched many sci-fi movies in my life... many movies in my life. Some can be considered to be classics and really good..., well for some reason this one beats them all. I think I could watch and rewatch this movie a shit ton of times. Wanna know how good this is? .. well its better than Event Horizon, Sphere and some other movies.. to me it seems even a better more sophisticated watch than Fourth Kind, Chronicles of Riddick, some of the good Paranormal Activity movies.. better than Hamlet 1990 .... its just great.. its one great movie.. better than the uncut Abyss 1989.. the only better movies are Braveheart and Lord of the Rings... even the first Woman in Black dragged on..  like.................. idk.. Seven was kinda nice watch but no.. this thing here Pandorum is something that is going on my mind too fucking much and I dont know why. Its just soo good ||| Good underrated film ||| Great SF horror movie who i have watched several times.👍 ||| who else is here after watching Elvis The Alien's movie recommendations to see what to watch out of the ones u haven't seen yet?? ;)   ...at least I cant remeber if ive seen this one yet or not hehe ||| Dead





Space ||| This movie is brilliant ||| Only 500 million miles? The earth does more than that travelling around the sun. ||| I just watched it. This movie was released in 2009, how the hell I haven't heard about it until now? This movie is actually entertaining. It's your pretty generic ""aliens/monster on the ship"" but they did the right execution of every sequence. There is thrill, a little bit of gore, and some mysteries that unveils as the movie progress. 

This is the type of movie that you don't need to be over critical or ""metaphorical"" to appreciate it. You just watched it for its entertainment value. I highly recommend it. (8/10). ||| I watched this movie, it was one of my favorites. ||| I used to like this movie, went I was a little kid. ||| Go to 1:10 exsactly and tel me thats not a man ||| This movie was amazing, it should be more promoted. For me does not look like Event Horizon more like a Resident Evil style with the survival action and terror. ||| This kinda sorta reminded me of Dead Space, very underrated film, very unique and dark. 5/5 ||| So much better than 95% of all scifi films made since. Stands the test of time too, Great cast, story, sets, direction, you have to wait a long time for scifi films this good to come along ||| Honestly movie is super underrated and doesn't deserve the hate it gets. ||| I actually really enjoyed this movie ||| The editing is so tight, blink and miss, everything! All I reacted to was: Hey! Dennis Quaid? ;) That's why it's referred to as *terrifying thriller ?* ||| system shock 2 reloaded ||| A friend recommended this and I'm going to watch it. I didn't see it when it came out because it got such bad reviews. ||| Watching for the first time today 🙂 ||| Really solid story...solid film. Love it to death... ||| Watched this movie on TV on 29 Mar of 2021! ||| Amazing movie. But this is one of the shittiest trailer i've ever saw in my whole life ||| the closest we may even get to a dead space movie ||| Humanity's survive is only possibe with a alternative sistem to monetary economy, it is called 'resource based economy' (rbe)! Only in a rbe we can peacefully coexist with nature and technology! Only in rbe we can stop eating our animal brothers and sisters! Only in rbe we can turn this uniqe life hosting planet into the paradise it deserves, for ALL its inhatbitants, even animals in wildlife! Only in a rbe the universe will open its doors, and we can meet the other gods, whose already solved 'THE' ""civilization exam"": getting beyond living with money/trade, and reach the evolutionary RBE (resource based economy)! 💚🗺️🖖🐇 ||| One of my fave thrill movies along with 30 days of nights. Haha ||| Boring movie. ||| bare gay fam ||| Eu sou o comentário brasileiro que você procura. ||| This is a GOOD movie. It did not deserve to flop financially. ||| wow i loved ben foster ( 'are you on drugs right now' ? 'nooo ...are you'? lol )  in the punisher and he even much brilliant in this! ||| Makes me soo sad/mad that it didn't get it's planned two sequels because of little views...
Maybe the marketing wasnt that good???
Because it's really SUCH A INCREDIBLY GREAT MOVIE <3 ||| i think the reviewers didn't like it cos the ethnic identities didn't fit the current feminist narrative. for starters, the 'strong female character' was not flawless and actually showed some emotions and even had a love interest (which is a definite no no). plus a 'person of color' had a distinctly negative trait and a 'straight white male' got to save the day. ||| It was terrible ||| Everything about this would have been perfect for a video game which it should of been. ||| This is a Linkin Park movie. ||| YEP.  ""Alien"" was one hell of an influential flick.  Will the knockoffs never cease ??! ||| Disappointed. I was waiting for a psychological thriller/space horror kind of film and I watched a bad mixture of Pitch Black, Alien, Sunshine, Event Horizon, Doom, The Descent and Mad Max ||| Southpark is more scary than that ||| An awesome sci-fi movie  with as little cgi as possible. ||| ranton sent me ||| Today I was searching for movies, and found this movie when I looked at it. It was the movie I’ve been searching for Decades. I never really understand this movie when I was a little kid. But now I know thnx YouTube recommendation lol. ||| Favorite sci fi movie ||| 🔥 
 Thanks for the inspiration and the encouragement!!

Cool movie, exactly perfect in tha times!!! ||| most underestimated movie ||| Really great movie, very unique. . Don't get the bad reviews. ||| I just had a dream about highly intelligent dogs and humans being left behind near the end of the earth, and they decided they'd get on a spaceship of their own and go to the new earth, so i looked up this movie, we saw it on dvd when it came out ||| I really enjoyed this movie and its all around thriller scyfi structure, its on my top rated films list to rewatch next to titan, Prometheus and other well made films, would love to see a sequel that revolves around how they adjusted to the new dangers of the new home, any previous existing life before they arrived, and if and survivors from eden were close when ejected and were forced to live similar lives to them when in dormant sleep, and finally, the risks and thrills of how they would get the life forms she was protecting since there was no reassurance they were ejected with the remaining survivors, or even if they are worth the risk do to the introduction of them possibly damaging the ecosystem of the new world, if the creators of this want to make a part 2 id love to brainstorm the storyline, im rewatching it with my woman tonight because its such a great film!! ||| I’ll pass👎 ||| Einbruch Zwecklos Diebstahl lohnt nicht ||| Love this movie.

In this video, I sing my Minecraft parody Diamond Pick, which is a funny parody of KSI's song Thick of It. Twi Shorts uses his diamond pick to mine as many rare ores in Minecraft as he can, but he faces challenges as other people do not appreciate the grind.

Disclaimer: This song is a parody of KSI Thick Of It. This parody uses completely originally created audio, and does not use anything from the original song's audio.

Then some of my favorite actors started showing up. At first I didn't even recognize them because as first-rate actors, I didn't notice. I couldn't believe the number of great actors involved in this project. I was blown away and in the end, just stunned. Peter Sarsgaard, Hank Azaria, Bobby Cannavale, James Franco, Chris Noth, Eric Roberts, Sharon Stone, just name a few, are unbelievable! Aside from all that, the poor lady's story is that of some very abusive and evil fuckheads. This is a must watch and why it didn't get more recognition is beyond me. Wait! WTF am I thinking? ||| Love this movie ||| That music in the background about killed it. ||| Interesting how Amanda decided to portray a woman who later in her career indulged in beastiality. I wonder if the film will cover that aspect of Linda life ||| I wanna watch this so bad ||| This movie was better than pron ||| Watch this film, Boogie Nights (1997) and the Fluffer (2001) to get an accurate portrayal of the Adult Entertainment Industry. ||| In my opinion this movie is underrated. And Amanda's performance was great. ||| 🧚🏻‍♂️☯️🌏🌌🦅 ||| UNDERRATED MOVIE ||| She looks like Shakira with that hair color. ||| She did her thing..what she suffered was imaginable poor thing.. ||| This may sound rude and critical but I feel like she thinks she deserves an actress award . Like entitlement - purity ||| Is it like perfect blue(anime)? ||| The movie actually sucks read the book ||| I didn't know that Marilyn Chambers was married to Linda's ex. haha ||| Is dogarama in this? ||| this movie brought me to tears...no human should be treated that way...wonderful acting ||| i was just a fluffer in the day ||| Does anybody know the name of the song in the second part?:( ||| You came here because you see it on post right ||| Come on Hollywood, couldn't you find a 72 Corniche that wasn't billowing blue smoke out the back of it? ||| One of the best films ||| Chuck,un capo.1:19 Esa es la actitud. ||| Read some ""oscars"" comments here... it's really a shame non of the award giving body recognized this amazing film, and mainly Seyfried's performance smdh 🤦 ||| A masterpiece in my opinion! Great Movie!!! ||| The entire cast is great but Peter sarsgaard ❤️❤️ ||| Lloyd from Lego Ninjago Movie 
Daphne from SCOOB ||| I cried a lot after this movie.. Linda Lovelace I don't knew her as a pornstar but got this trailer as YT recommendation. After it i also watched deep throat..i feel very sorry for Linda. Sorry for what she has to bear..This movie changed my mentality completely..RIP Linda ||| Wtf 🤯 ||| This movie was amazing ||| I love this movie ||| Chuck should have been SHOT...PERIOD ||| One of the worst movies of all time! ||| Seth cohen what’re you doing ||| And the deepthroat? ||| Wow😍 ||| This actress is too childish. It’s just wrong. ||| I’m a simple girl, I see James Franco in a thumbnail and click it 😆 ||| Been there...Nope ||| this was one of the saddest movies ive ever seen tbh ||| bugün fuk_u beni sinirlendirdiğinden, kız kıza arkadaşı +Z için bir tribute olarak bu trailer'ı paylaşayım dedim... hiçbir şey hatırlamadığını söylerse ona ""Ada Lovelace"" sana uymaz, Linda Lovelace CUK oturur diyorum... BV ve C için tavsiyem ise şu: +Z ye sorun bakalım, bu ... Lovelace olayı ne ayak diye...! çıkış yaptığı film: *Deep Throat* Türkçeye *Ağaçkakan* diye de çevrilebilir belki... yalancı kaltak fuk_u saygılı  olacaksın, kıpırdayanı vururum demiştim değil mi?

not: senin ... Lovelace olayından eski BYK'nın da haberi var, o sinirle ve onu daha tam çözememişken forward etmiştim... umarım bundan istifade seni çok çalıştırmamıştır... çalıştırdıysa da mesleki risk olarak kabullen... ha ha ha... çalıştırmış olabilir diyorum çünkü *malatya kayısısına* NOT verdiğini söylemişti pis pis gülerek... sana kaç not verdi? ||| I just watched this movie Linda went through a lot ...her own mother sold her out she should had protected Linda ..if only Linda told her mother..maybe she should talked to her father. ||| This movie was really good! ||| Why is nobody talking about the fact that the guy at 0:42 (who says ""more pezaz"") is David from Friends ??? ||| The perv in Hollywood ||| I don't understand why Amanda Seyfried took this role. ||| I'm a mouse! DUH. ||| It was a beautiful movie. ||| Pay very , very good attention while watching this movie.  This is almost every day life we don't see but it's just in every subdivision or town, city etc, etc. Very sad true story. ||| she’ll get an oscar. mark my words ||| What is that song ||| So, this is a feminist icon? ||| inspired by The Dirty Picture i guess ||| Amanda is unrecognizable here.
That's her talent.

But where's Finn?? ||| Is very very good this movie and the actress is wonderfull i love it ||| So it was fifty shades of grey ||| im very excited to watch this ||| Lindsey Lohan was originally up for this role. But she was just a mess that she lost the part. ||| A very strong performance by Amanda Seyfried ||| I love you Amanda Seyfried, I love all of your movies. U are underrated and just plain beautiful ||| R.I.P. Hugh Hefner ||| Boogie nights part 2: Required female version of classic films, that are only made to please the Feminazi's. ||| ""... and then i feel free"" .
Oh my, didnt it make tear  down a bit. ||| we r worst then animal ||| This movie brought me to tears ||| filme ridículo história mentirosa ninguém força a ninguém a fazer nada o filme mostrou que ela gostava de fazer o filme é outra pq ela não falou pro pai que apanhava ela é uma vagabunda lixo pessoa ||| you guys should really read inferno, tells u the real story ||| good movie, sad part bout it was its a true story. ||| i hate this movie because it protrais her SO wrong. she acutally suffered alot but her Story is told wrong ||| excelente ||| Here for James😂❤ ||| Amanda looks perfect when her hair is short like in the movie ""in time"" i dont like her hair now ||| Am I really high or is this trailer just strange ||| song ? ||| ""Boogie Nights"" is the best film about porn to date!!! ||| oww seth cohen why... ||| chuck was just like so much of the scene you are just meat for the grinder the girls are fucked who come into porn why else would you be there ||| I think Amanda  looks better with the dark hair :0 Being a natural blonde is more unique, of course, but it would be nice to see her with a less ingénue look. ||| LOL, the same old bull shit dream that producers, directors, pimps, managers, representatives, sleazy agents in the adult industry or porn biz use on luring people of a promise dream or fantasy of making newcomers or someone rich and / or famous is a facade the adult industry or porn biz use to market, capitalize, profit on their investments (People exploited or people allowing to exploit themselves) in the adult arena, adult films, products (Magazines, Videos, Merchandising, Sex Toys, etc., etc.). At the end there's no glamour, no glory nor no respectability for none of the porn performers or ex-porn stars in the world of mainstream reality but only in their own minds or short term fantasy of fans, sadistic people and abusers as you can see in Linda Lovelace life story! (Among, the naive & exploited poster woman / people of porn, sort to speak!) ||| Twitter brought me here ||| this movie damaged me i couldn't sleep for month linda was always on my mind i keep crying over and over again, then i read the book and omg it broke me it was very hard to get over her story. ||| I saw a documentary on the impact of Linda Lovelace on American sexual mores in the 70s, and the turning point it meant for pornography as big business. She had quite a story, and of course it was sad how she fell into this whole thing essentially becoming a pawn for abuse. From the trailer I'm getting a slight Paul Thomas Anderson tease. Beyond that, seeing Chloe Sevigny is inspiration enough to check this out, I do so miss the indie ""It Girls"" and cutting edge style provocateurs  who used to be the faces and voices for tastemaker style in music, fashion, and film: seems these days everything in those areas has to be affiliated with a tabloid fixture or reality star to get any shine.  Also, the fact that it sounds like they have Alice Smith on the soundtrack instead of the usual Billboard top 10 suspects could be further indication that this project won't be a vapid treatise on Lovelace's story and phenomenon. ||| this movie should've won an oscar.. or at least should have been nominated! ||| Wow they made Sharon stone ugly and unrecognizable. I'll watch for her. ||| Chuck always said he did nothing wrong to Linda, the abuse he gave her was him telling her that he was never going to let her go. I kinda watched this and in a few parts freaked me out so I turned it off, but Seyfield was awesome. ||| i love this movie & make me crying so much. ||| Is this not out in the UK.

People need to realizes they are the stalkers lol and act like this. ||| Something was wrong ||| This is first time watching The Roommate in Nov 25, 2024 because Minka Kelly My Crush 😻 11/25/24 ||| Great remake of the 90s movie single white female. It's such an epic movie, and this modern version is brill !!! ||| Movie was ok. Rushed. Some lame parts but overall I think I'll watch it again ||| Leighton 🔥🔥 ||| Thank you MoBrosStudios for introducing me to this Z-Grade thriller through your ""worst Spongebob episodes"" videos.

[bit he used is at 2:19 ] ||| I liked the movie until the cat scene. Now I feel sick. I'm out! ||| Nice film ||| I only have 1hr to search for a good movie and 2hrs to watch. How’s this movie? Is it worth it? ||| Apparently, there are several roommate movies-the one with Bridgette Fonda was the best. But, I was looking for the classic one.... ||| Love this movie ❤❤❤ ||| Oh cuddles 😿 ||| This film scared the hell out of me as a 12 year old kid. The cat scene really messed me up and the tattoo scene ||| Dziś w tv o 22 ||| Yes Guys I Love That Trailer ||| I feel like this is just an unofficial remake of Single White Female. ||| This is one crazy scary movie 😊❤ ||| Yes Guys I Love The Roommate ||| I just finish Gossip Girl and didn’t have no idea Blair played in this movie. ||| Quem veio só pela blair ||| It’s on Tubi, I’m bout to check it out. ||| There are actors and actresses who look a like in this movie. Leighton and Minka, Matt and Cam. ||| This, the stepfather, obsession, and boy next door are my favorite psychological thriller movies ||| I wouldn't mind having Blair obsessed with me like that hahaha. That's the queen B!! ||| A Sara e a Rebeca parecem irmas. ||| They girls look alike ||| Suggest me some movies like this one ||| i had a strange obsession with this movie when i was 9 lol ||| Bom filme ||| The ending could have been slightly realistic. Show some cops or something. Show a little bit of trauma. I know an ex is an ex but someone still died! And all she could think about was dinner and returning back to the same dorm room. Yeah the type of movie to watch when you want to kill time. Not an insult or anything. You just have these kind of movies I suppose. ||| 0:19 the actress looks so familiar who plays Debbie Winslow ||| I strongly feel that there is a slight difference between love and obsession or control so to speak... I feel so sad for Rebecca because from my eyes, all I see is a girl who just wanted a friend and all she did was care for her, remove her (Sara's) obstacles or sadness whatever right? And she used to wait for her whenever she was out late and enquire if she was okay all the time... She was very caring, loving, and she let Sara be herself and do whatever she wanted but she just wanted one thing from her besides Sara's happiness... She just wanted company... We all need someone to be our shade in sunlight... Rebecca, I feel, didn't feel at home with anyone... even with her parents like for example the conversation her dad and she had late at night at one scene... She was not close to anyone.... Maybe she felt that no one understood her...

I don't care if you think I'm thinking wrong... But, to be honest this is my opinion and I love this movie ... and I love Rebecca... She was never forceful so how can it be obsession??? She let her go whenever it came to her being late, or choosing what she wanted except just one thing... That she never wanted Sara to leave her... I dont think its unhealthy... 

But yes all said and done, I do agree that the path of violence that she always chose was wrong. No arguing there... And also the cat scene is where she was so wrong... She didn't have to kill the cat... I won't argue there

However I feel that she really loved Sara although she was psychotic... 

I love the character of Rebecca portrayed in this movie... She really did care bout Rebecca no denying that yet her way of loving her by removing her obstacles or making her pain go away was so wrong...

Overall one heck of a movie.... I have a regret that I didn't watch this movie sooner... Just completed watching it now... ||| i dont think the movie should've ended with sara moving out it should've ended with her being swatted by rebecca's mother and have sara stand trial ||| I love this movie so much. ||| Not buying it... Zyprexa makes people obese ||| This was better than Single White Female, to me. More shock value! 🎥 🤯 ||| No way a chick that hot only has one friend ||| Dawn from titans was a psychopath roommate ||| As Sebastian said gossip girl does produce the best serial killers ||| love this movieeee ||| Fantastic movie ||| November 27 2022, about to watch this movie with my roommates 🥴🤙🏻 ||| Oh my god, they were roomates ||| End of 2022 ||| Bof bof très déçue quand même du rôle qu'on a donné à l'actrice principale Sarah.. Hyper naïve sur les bords et ça jusqu'au bout du film quand même MDRRR. Euh à la fin ça m'a tellement choquée qu'elle a quand même préféré sauter par la fenêtre au lieu de détacher sa meilleure amie Irène alors que c'était normalement le BUT quoi, de la sauver et elle s'en fui ? Hahahaha. Breff vraiment nul à chier quand même. Et donc oui c'est toujours les même têtes d'ado qu'on voit, très clichés et stéréotypés des jeunes américains 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️. ||| A perfect remake matireal for tollywood ||| This follows Single White Female a little too closely. ||| I just realized that Danneel Ackles was in this as Irene.

So crazy! ||| Une fille profonde et sensible avec des graves troubles mentaux qui se passionne pour une fille superficielle et vide.. triste ||| single white female much? ||| Thriller movies these days are such cliches but this one is clearly not one. This movie comes out hot. I'm lovin it. ||| Rebecca Looks Like My Aunt. Except My Aunt's Not Psycho Lol. ||| This movie was kinda sad especially how Leighton Meester died at the end ||| This is a plagiarism from the movie Single White Female (1992). The original movie is better. ||| this movie has so many actors we know who became way bigger and there's vampire diaries cast members her, easy A, leighton of course as well ||| i kinda liked rebecca ||| What if this flick was actually rated R? ||| minka kelly so beautiful ||| 0:57 They look like twins.. That's pretty creepy! 😱 ||| I would kill to have her looking at me that way 💛 Leighton Meester ||| If its leighton idc, she can have me lol ||| A person that's a stalker or either a psychopath  comes in many shapes and forms it could be your best friend or it could be someone you don't know thank God  for background checks these days you just can't tell better safe than sorry ||| I love this movie because I relate to Rebecca's unstable personality. I don't buy the movie's diagnosis of Bipolar disorder for her though. Borderline personality disorder seems to fit much better. ||| I want a best friend like Rebecca, I found tht she was the only one who cared and loved Sara the most😭😭😭 ||| Finding Worst Roommate Ever on Netflix got me here ||| Holly 💩 Jamie from That's My Boy was an Obsessive Stalker 😱 ||| This is one of my favorite movies of all times, I’ve seen it at least five times and counting… ||| Blair Waldorf and Rachel gatina ?

hkC2JgC9CR4,Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965),"1965 trailer for Dr. Who And The Daleks starring Peter Cushing, Roy Castle, Jennie Linden, Roberta Tovey, Barrie Ingham",movie,236827.0,1216.0,283,PT3M4S,"Dig the doo on that dame. Its an amazing helmet hair! ||| Dr Who and the Zionists ||| Cushing & castle were so miss cast. This would have been good if Hartnell & the cast were available ||| I remember going to the pictures to watch this as a kid along with hundreds of others. We screamed the place down and was frightened beyond belief. To watch Dr. Who and the Daleks on an enormous screen when no one even had a tv set was just amazing. ||| The red Dalek is very sporty-looking! ||| Very scary even from behind the couch. ||| Daleks from Maldek ||| Oh no, daleks shooting explosive (?) steam 😆 still quite entertaining tho 😁 ||| did they make colorful daleks because of Technicolor? ||| I'm hoping they retcon the Timeless Child and say that THIS version is the Doctor that the Master was referring to. The Fugitive Doctor could be another incarnation of Cushing's from an alternate universe. Would be interesting. ||| Try harder , I'm not going to try any more I'm done no more .Ian I'm leaving ||| You can imagine how mind blowing it would in 1965 to see a full blown full colour Dalek on a full blown screen. ||| Can you imagine if they did a deep fake version of Peter Cushing's Doctor for the 60th anniversary?  The fans would probably flip out.  😄 ||| This surprisingly does not look too bad for the time it came out. ||| How did they manage to make these films? Are they also licensed by bbc too? ||| Peter Cushing in alot of movies ||| Who cares if it's canon you nerds ||| Theory:These films actually are canonical.
It could possibly be the Doctor after he first left Gallifrey to go to Earth. He built the Tardis & later forgot he made it (or he returned idk). Then the Hartnell era happens.

So basically,I think Cushing is technically the 0th Doctor. ||| uncanonth doctor ||| I didn’t know this exists ||| although if in the 60`s you had watched the original episode of the daleks during the run of hartnell`s era you would already know what was going to happen in this film, and as film trailers go although a very exciting glimpse at the film after watching this trailer then i don`t think that you would need to watch the film after all as the trailer more or less gave the film`s plot away, and regardless of what doctor who fans think of this film and especially of the doctor not being played by hartnell but by peter cushing even if cushing does a good job playing the doctor, even if he does play him as a human and not an alien let alone not as a tough older man who is a bit too clever for his own good but as a forgetful but brilliant old codger, this film since i probably ended up watching it several times in the 80`s, and especially at christmas might as well be my introduction to doctor who if i perhaps hadn`t grown up on watching the peter davidson era, which at the time apart from the odd episode i can hardly remember, so for at least one stage of my life i probably remember watching this more than i remember watching the actual programme, and as i`m a huge sci fi film fan watching this back in the day was both exciting and thrilling to watch and even now it`s possible that i still can`t find all the words to describe just how much i fell in love with this film and the dalek invasion of earth as well, and it`s even possible in a different universe if the television series was never made but only these films then i wouldn`t have a problem with this, and although this isn`t exactly the doctor who we fell in love, i do think that it`s possible that a true doctor who fan would find a part in there heart for these doctor who dalek films let alone a possible space on there shelf for a dvd of the films, ||| Just to think k used to quake in my boots with those dustbins ||| At this point what is and is not canon just depends on the viewer, after all saying that the only thing that can be canon is the new things means that in the end the worst thing will be canon. If you keep rolling the dice in the end you will lose. ||| The corner general/grocery store in our little burg once featured the comic book version of this movie in one of those wire, rotating racks. The notion of the Daleks and their association with Dr. Who imprinted on me right then and there. Has to be close to fifty-six years ago. ||| I told the icky babies to leave the Earth as fast as they can ||| is that ""record breaker"" Roy Castle ? ||| Grand Moff Tarkin is a Time Lord 😂 ||| HUH! ""Every move you make..."" Maybe that is where Sting got the lyrics! ||| When the Daleks were armed with their deadly fire extinguishers. ||| It is actually Canon now. It's a British film based on the real Dr Who ||| https://youtu.be/QCJ_a5AYVEY ||| The Star Wars films ||| Interesting saying it wasnt canon because, when this film was made the tv show hadn’t explicitly said he wasn’t human and certainly hadn’t mentioned Timelords.

The most the tv show had committed to is that he was from a different planet in the future so he could have been human on a far flung colony. ||| Looks like a retarded 'Lost In Space' robot! ||| Peter Cushing beats Jodie Whittaker by a million Gallifreyan miles. ||| this is far better than modern dr who with the fake dr Jodie in it. ||| Those Blue/Gold/Silver Daleks are my all time favourite designs. ||| Peter Cushing was very underrated as the Dr.
In this film. But I thought he played the part very well.
A talented man he was, may he rip ||| I would have preferred they made Dr. Who canon instead of that Timeless Child nonsense. 

 In a deserted rocky planet surrounded by hills and topped by orange skies  the calm of everyday life was disturbed by a thunderous  explosion. Something  of a glow several times  the shine of either of the twin stars  appeared over a hill. The deserted planet soon turned out not to be so deserted after all as groups of natives from the region began to surround  the mysterious glowing object atop of the hill.  It was some kind of cylindrical object but not quite. It kept fazing in and out of sight . Suddenly the object began blinking  and changing its form until it took on the shape of a strange blue-box. What could be described as doors  slowly  opened and black smoke came  out from the dark interior. A few seconds later a figure slowly came out of the object.  It was  a man with white hair. The hair was partly black but presumably the result of flying debris caused by whatever calamity was unleashed upon this strange object . His face was also slightly darkened and the man  coughed  uncontrollably until he composed himself and greeted the few natives brave enough to climb the hill and get close to the object.

""Oh dear.  Sorry about the commotion.   I seem to have crashed. What  year is this?""

The natives were stunned by the stranger's words.

""Pardon my manners. Allow me introduce to myself. My name is Doctor William Whoblenton but everybody calls me Dr. Who.

Introducing Dr. Who (The Other) :D. ||| He's tenants clone. With only one heart. And his ability to regenerate was suppressed. For a time. ||| Best dr ever ||| Where can I watch the full movie of the original Dr. Who? ||| Wow that's look excellent ||| Why do the Daleks look better here than the original dr who daleks in the 60s ||| R2D2? ||| ook ||| Oh my this looks terrible. ||| A british movie with Peter Cushin. Where is Christopher Lee? Is he one of the Daleks? ||| Might as well make this canon now, since Chibnall is shoving any convoluted lore-destroying crap into the show these days... ||| Doubt whether the doctors police box could fly to TESCO in Huddersfield. ||| I absolutely love these films. Best Daleks Ever. ||| So this is what happened to Moff darken before he went kaboom ||| Not as good as the original TV serial, but it looks gorgeous and Peter Cushing is great as Dr. Who. ||| 1:08
If they can see and hear everything Dr. Who and friends do, why do they need an alarm bell? ||| Thals were blond giants? They're no bigger than the humans. ||| ""Every breath you take. Every move you make. Every bond you break. Every step you take. DALEKS WILL BE WATCHING YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" ||| This wasn't as good as Original Who TV. It's far better than anything New Who. ||| Who knew Cushing did this? I'm flabbergasted. Never even knew!

btw: You probably know playstore has a couple of Dalek voice generators. ||| This is not cannon ||| Looks like  the Dalek`s fist appearance ||| everything wrong with this movie

1. the doctor didnt make the tardis, he stole it.
2. the doctor is not a scientist from earth, he is a galifreyan time lord.
3. And his name is not dr who its the doctor or doctor ||| the doctor didnt make the tardis, he stole it. ||| This movie represents everything great about 60's cinema and I love every bit of it :) ||| I guess this could be considered canon now because of the Timeless Child arc. ||| Oxy acetylene cutter great Daleks ||| Fans waffling on for years about these films being bad just because they ""aren't canon"" is the epitome of misplaced fandom nerd rage. These movies are a delight. ||| It's not canon ||| Saw this at the cinema as a kid and remember being terrified 😂 ||| I've actually seen this ||| My theory is that this doctor is an older version of David tennants meta doctor that was left with rose ||| Where can I watch the full movie? ||| For all the people saying this ""isn't canon,"" just remember: it is canon in its own universe. ||| well this may as well be cannon now chibs has shit all over everything ||| This is canon ||| Jesus, this is a flashback! ||| Here's a crazy episode idea for Doctor Who.


The Doctor meets the granddaughter of this Doctor and have an short adventure together. ||| This shit is why ""Dr. Who"" went insane and joined the Empire. ||| I enjoyed both movies with Peter Cushing as the Doctor. Granted it is variation of the series but it is close enough. ||| Daleks are absolute bastards ||| ""Every move you make we can see, everything you utter we can hear""( So just like now then with a mobile phone and TV etc.) ||| When i saw this at the cinema it was the first time i saw it in colour and i thought it was amazing with the daleks in different colours. ||| I much prefer the movies to the TV series, so much so that I got the black Dalek from first movie made for me :) ||| THIS BETTER NOT BE CANNON ||| 1:42 Doctor who vs Gingers ||| Doctor Tarkin, I presume :D ||| Awesome movie! I like watching it! ||| I always liked the red Dalek for some reason ||| Haha this actually looks really good. Looks like it might be scary and a laugh to watch nowadays. Peter Cushing looks like a good Dr Who. Daleks look scary and the effects look impressive tbh ||| Why does the inside of the tardis look like a lab ||| this movie is a generic 60s sci-fi movie interpretation of doctor who.
I love it. ||| I like this movie, it's big, colorful, fun and Peter Cushing is excellent as the Doctor. It may not be canon, but it's worth checking out. ||| Thoughts:

Love the look.... Dr. Who channelling Lloyd Bridges? 

Ice Daleks?!

So those ""giants"" are like, 6"" taller than average humans, at best?

""Doctor Who, the brilliant science professor""... mmkay ||| I remember seeing this film at the cinema in the late 1960's and being terrified by it as I was only about 10 years old at the time. to see the daleks in colour was amazing, because doctor who was seen on the bbc by most families in black and white. I recall reading many years later, that the bbc where so impressed with the film version that they borrowed the daleks for the making of the next TV edition! |||  ||| this movie sucks ||| i love the classic b movie feel off this ||| Can't wait for this to come out!

What?!

Apart from enlightening content, it really succeeds in exposing Milton Friedman for the arrogant obnoxious jerk that he was.

One good answer to M. Friedman (and Thomas Friedman, as well), can be found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As soon as industrial workers around the world gain the rights to which they are entitled. motivation to outsource American jobs will greatly diminish.
  ||| It was your hero George W. Bush that went crazy spending. In 2008, he declared that the U.S. economy was having a ""hangover"" and chuckled about people losing their jobs and homes. He then left the sinking ship for Obama. ||| Wrong. If 56% is being spent on Offense (what the government calls defense), then that leaves only 44% left for everything else. Which makes sense. The U.S. spends more on military spending than any other nation on earth.
Nice try though. Maybe go back to school for math? ||| The amount spent on military/intelligence released by the U.S. government is hardly accurate or trustworthy. They aren't going to say openly ""oh hey everyone, our secret spy program is costing you guys $X dollars, and we'll release the detailed expense report to everyone, including China and Russia."" Not! Military spending is eating about 56% of taxes, by independent accounts. It's like an open buffet of fat pigs gorging at the trough. The Offense (Defense) Budget needs to be slashed up to 90%. ||| Not to mention... Obama trying to step on and trample the constitution whenever he can... to do what?  Make us a NANY State?  Because he knows what's best for everyone!  LOL  It's easy to sit back and make accusations but when you can't back it up and you just curse someone out, it show your own lack of intelligence!  ||| Workers Rights!  ||| Workings rights?  Umm, did you forget there is an organization called OSHA!?!? (set up my, republicans!)  So, all republicans want are the ""right to work"" not requiring people to be part of unions!  And then unions for federal jobs? That's a JOKE!  Unions workers are 1%, they live off the money of hard working americans anyways! To do what? What OSHA already does?! LOL   Medicaid was CUT for the first time EVER by Obama!  Obama FORCING people to buy Health Care!  You need to educate yourself!  ||| NO!  I am not wrong!  I know EXACTLY when the Florida National Guard arrived and I know EXACTLY when the 82nd Arrived!  I am part of the FNG and was apart of the 82nd that actually went there! I hardly think, anyone that lived there... knew anything about when it happened!  I'll clue you in on something, the news hardly ever gets what is going on with the military right!  Something called OPSEC, is why the military doesn't openly share information with them!  ||| Well it sounds like you have a problem with them!  I don't see them having a problem with anybody, nor do I!  If you want hate to stop, you must look within first!  ||| If I had as much money as yours to use, I'd make a REAL Documentary with REAL truth and call myself a filmmaker too!  Must be nice to be able to make 2 films with money you didn't earn and call yourself a filmmaker!  It's pretty sad when your own family doesn't support you, take a hint Kid! (Jamie Johnson!)  If you really wanted the truth, but some contact info on your 1% website so I could talk to you about some real truth! 
 ||| Just watched it, I don't see how you can call it a Documentary!  For starters, We had Soldiers helping out the NEXT DAY in Louisiana, the Florida National Guard was there helping save lives.  What you said about the effort of the Military and George W. Bush and handling the situation is WRONG!  If you are going to do a documentary and skew the facts the way you want them, then you are no better then the 1%!  Why can't we get away from the 1% or 99%... we are all the 100%! America!  ||| So all I'm seeing so far in this trailer is that rich people are generally douchebags, and class warfare exists. None of this is exactly revolutionary. The difference between America and other countries is I and every other American have just as much of a chance at becoming a rich douchebag as these already-rich douchebags did.

I thought he was relatively socialist?

Here's some Zen for ya, Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things! ||| Geez, you give a book they chew on the covers...That's what you get for ""assuming""...remember what this country is founded on, it has faults, but so does everything.  The grass is never greener on the other side, you still need to mow and water it. ||| @uagrantc So no other ""person"" wastes time commenting, you wouldn't be alive because the people that came here before you would not have ""had the vision"" to come to this great country in the first place...hence YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BORN!

BTW, looks like the fine people of this country are finally fed up with the cockroaches that have spread into the cities...can you say RAID!  I hear they kill insects dead!

GO Capitalism! ||| @Thaxton Your problem bud is you can't figure out how to take your finger you're pointing at everyone else and turn your hand around and point it at yourself...I feel sorry for you, because you really are the ""99%"", unfortunately your math is flawed...All I can say is thank GOD, 99% of the people in the USA are not as blind as you are,

It's more like 47%, and all you have to do to be successful is succeed 51% of the time...So we ""the 54%"" still have hope! ||| @Thaxton Huh?  I never said ""free market capitalism""...so sorry I thought I was dealing with intelligence here...guess not...""provide an opportunity to become wealthy"" for most people (99%) now I understand it, means MONEY only...LET ME REAL CLEAR, I hope you listen...MONEY is only one variable that contributes to wealth...In order to accumulate true wealth, you must understand MONEY has NO-thing to do with the ability to create it. ||| @SoloWing808 Maybe YOU don't [have the opportunity], that's your fault...I am neither born rich, or poor, I am 44 years old married with 2 beautiful children, I AM RICH beyond my wildest dreams...I do however own my own business, and unlike yourself (I'm assuming) I not only sign the back of my paycheck, I ALSO SIGN THE FRONT!

Being rich is relative, your perception of rich/power is the problem, let me ask you a question, ""Who's the one that CHOOSES to listen?

Who's the dumbass now?

 ||| @uagrantc like a snake eating its own tail ||| Respond to this video...          american govt likes to care of their super rich! ||| ... comes the REVOLUTION! ||| @uagrantc We don't have the opportunity to become wealthy in this country dumbass. You're either born rich or born poor and you stay where you are because 1% have the power to buy out the law makers, politicians, military, media, and police to keep the 99% down while preserving their own wealth for generations at the expense of others. Why do you think banks get bailed out and not the people on the streets? Take a look in the mirror before you call other people morons. ||| @velveetaslingshot - ""...greed and corruption obviously serve some function related to the survival of the human species."" - I would argue that greed and corruption lead to the extinction of the species. think about it... ||| @njiuma Think about what? My comment was an observation on the behaviour of human beings in general and the fact that you can not change human nature. My point is that in terms of evolution and Darwinism, ie survival of the fittest, greed and corruption obviously serve some function related to the survival of the human species. Otherwise it would not exist if it did not benefit the perpetuation of the species. Think. ||| @velveetaslingshot - ""You can judge people for embracing their primitive survival instincts, but who is to say that they are wrong for doing so?"" - But the playing field is increasingly becoming unfair. When large corporations block smaller competing companies, then finance political campaigns to determine who gets elected, the elected ratifies or abolishes laws that favor said corporations, Federal Reserve bails out banks - then government taxes citizens to pay the Fed with interest... think... ||| @Thaxton - ""We are talking about the exchange of goods and services, not weather and sunlight."" - good point, I believe in minimal government regulation, preventing unfair compteition i.e. trust busting of President Teddy Roosevelt, breakups of Standard Oil / AT&T / Microsoft etc - but Free Market Capitalism overall. That's why I'm voting for Ron Paul for President. There does seem to be too wide a disparity between super-rich and barely surviving in America right now. Occupy Wall Street... ||| You freaking idiots, if this country never provided an opportunity to become wealthy in the first place you wouldn't be alive you MORON! ||| @Thaxton  You said: ""We can cettainly design a world that is ""the way we want it to be"". ""    Really? Let me know when that happens. ||| So I saw Jamie's film and it was typical ultra liberal BS. In economics there are positive economics and normative economics. Normative economics is ""the way we would like the world to be"" and positive economics is ""the way the world really is"". It is inherent in human nature to seek wealth and then to guard it jealously once you have it. You can judge people for embracing their primitive survival instincts, but who is to say that they are wrong for doing so? ||| @nammoo89 By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more together than we achieve alone. ||| Huge respect for Jamie and I hope you keep working in this direction, we are so many people with similar thoughts around the planet. I hope our generation will make something happen. ||| 2006 before the crash and all the bail outs  ||| I just saw 1% on Netflix. I just wanted to thank Jamie Johnson and company for making this documentary. I hope to see more from them on this issue.  ||| @nammoo89 Hah, living in Norway is a thousand times better than living in USA, the ""socialist government"" we have to deal with here is nothing compared to how fucked up the US has become. ||| @Jzone527 
Secret society? What planet do you live on? 

The Koch Bros., the ""Tea Party"" and Fox News have been pushing all of these perverse Ideals right out in the open, for decades. It is NO ""secret"" my friend.  ||| But people is more and will wake up becouse they feel the opression. It never was the goverment but this secret society JFK started talking about before he was killed he gave you a fair warning about the machine and we made it so powerful than now wants it all no caring for the human race but we as a world need to stand up togheter... ||| People need to understand that history reapits it's self and no empire known can succed because piramids need slaves the ones on the real bottom sufer the whiping of the master,the ones in the middle work for eventually for nothing when the ones at top exploiting every nation and finally it's own will comsum everithing  and kill it's people at the end! ||| @tswagg504   well its too bad that everyone is a corporate drone, your car, your food, your technology. Just about everything in your life is under corporate control, there  are few small independent businesses left. the rich will only get richer through deals will politicians and mergers, and the poor will be left in the lurch, b/c the market is fast becoming costly and not free. ||| @mundawgs what we have in this country today isn't capitalism, its fascism.....capitalism is great because its fair because absolutely anyone can become rich, or at least work for themselves. ||| @nammoo89 

So, giving someone with a disability money they did not work for or innovate for is a bad idea.

But given money to someone who happened to come from your sperm, money they did not work for or innvate for is a good idea.

sounds fair to me. ||| @mongobobo 

no matter how super rich, be punished when they die?

Did not agree with most of this video, but I do have a problem with the Inheritance tax.  Starting with the fact that you can't punish a dead person, unless you happen to be a god, they're dead. ||| Or he could have done a documentary on the pitfalls of being rich.  Instead what we get is a genertic class warfare piece.  That accomplishes nothing but get us angry at the rich for being rich. ||| I was disapointed with this documentary.  No facts, no figures, heresay about the dangers, they touched on a lot of good ideas but never engages in any of them.  Johnson could have made a compelling documentary how rich people percieve themselves with his father, and the obvious conflict that he had between his wealth and his hippie roots.  He could of done a documentary on the inheritance tax and whether or not that is fair or part of the free market.  continued ||| Dear Top 1%,
It's not that I ""want"" what you have. It's that I ""want"" to have the opportunity to have any form of prosperity. Pay back into the system that has provided your wealth. We do.
Sincerely,
The Other 98%

**close the loopholes!!** ||| @powerface71 While your assertions to your perceived problem are valid, the data does not support your implied solution. Income tax receipts did not go down, as a % of GDP when the brackets were drastically lowered, since the 1960's. Not only that, but most of the federal budget is income tranfser, like social security. The income tax share has also risen among ""the one percent."" ||| @TheDukeljk You sir are a very misguided. The amassing of wealth by the 1% without social balance is destroying this country. What will they do when people are so broke and destitute they cannot afford to but their products?  They might want to re-read their bibles. ""Truly, I say unto you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. [Matthew 19:23] You cannot serve both God and Money.

God makes me rich beyond worldly possessions.   ||| worth watching. i was shocked to learn that warren buffet disowned his grand daughter because she was in the film. there is nothing wrong with questioning things. being right or wrong is another issue. weird.  ||| I hope Jamie Johnson continues making these docs. He is in a unique position to comment on the power and influence of the 'superrich', and has an unusual empathy for non-material values. I think he may just have a chance to have a 'happy' life.
Good Luck, Jamie ||| The very rich making it very hard for there to be new rich people. Capitalism isn't working, b/c companies join together and make multinationals.

Why would you call for the destruction of the country with arguably the best standard of living in the world? You must be broken... ||| @getclogged Our banking system is no longer capitalist, we have legalized certain banks to print as much money as they please. Blaming all rich people for our problems is a silly mistake. I do not pity the bum on the street that sits day after day doing nothing to improve himself nor do I admire the bank that can inflate it self while devaluing currency for its own gain. I would give you exactly what needs to be changed in banking, but its a fairly long discussion. ||| you can find the solution at thezeitgeistmovement(dot)com ||| @xadam2dudex I wish you could set up your moral society on another planet so I could stand back and laugh as it collapses. At least everyone will be equally poor and deprived in your society... ||| @KentAllard No like that man on the street claiming to be crippled that walks just fine. Actually its not his fault he is on the street, it is the backwards moral code society has trained him. In this code the weaker and sicker he is the more of your money he is allowed to have, never mind the fact he has done nothing to benefit anyone but him self. Am I harsh? Perhaps it is not me who is harsh, but reality... ||| @TheLogicJunkie not really, there are many rich that were not from a  rich family. ex: oprah. there are more. but in reality anyone can become rich, depends on what you think is rich and if your going to do something about it. ||| ONE PERCENT, ONE PERCENT, ONE PERCENT, ONE PERCENT. ||| Mo' money mo' problems. :) ||| ""but he still has no class.""

what the hell does this even mean? class and wealth are not one in the same. if you want proof, look for any video on youtube featuring the hiltons or brandon davis, who all come from extremely wealthy families, but have less moral character and respect for their fellow people than the majority of impoverished families i have worked with and spoken to. ||| It will be shown here(free) at 10a.m.:

You give a construction worker a million dollars, he maybe rich, but he still has no class. So, what good would distributing wealth do? The poor people will just spend it all and the stupid rich people already do that. 

Middle class people tend to not be so stupid, thus it's why we need to expand the middle class to people who actually have the values to be in the middle class. ||| So true, Ive been searching for this movie online, and it is like the mirage that never was.. haha.. so much for a free world!! ||| where can i see the documentary the one percent?
thank you ||| WHERE.  CAN.  THIS.  DOCUMENTARY.  BE.  VIEWED?!?  Someone please post it to Google video, or segment it on YouTube.  It NEEDS to be seen, and should not be censored on behalf of the banker class. ||| I have read several times that the Rothschilds alone (who are the keepers of the Vatican Treasury) have over 70 per cent of all the wealth of the planet. So that leaves 30 percent for the rest. Then there is 1 per cent who takes half of that. So that leaves 15 percent for most of us to fight over. ||| that makes no sense, people work them selves to the bone everyday for almost nothing, no, if you do well in life, you should be able to keep it in the family, but your statement doesn't really make much sense. ||| the problem is regulation, right now in the US we are seeing what happens when a free market is let to run itself without any rules, here in the US.  Not all people are self righteous enough to have a complete self regulating system.  In the end, some one gets screwed over, the only real way anything works is a perfect balance between a free market and government regulation. ||| Where can this film be found?  It's not on NetFlix, and not on Google Video, either. ||| non-producers, you mean like a corporate CEO? ||| Send me some percentage! ||| Jamie Johnson release this movie already. or but the damn thing on youtube for free. It's not like you need the money, just call it a lost. ||| I honestly don't remember what your question was.  I don't on the other hand hate or dislike wealth.  It's not a matter of wealth or class it's simple arithmetic.  You earn more you pay more, you earn less you pay less.  Now if that doesn't make sense to you it is only because you are biased and overcome with greed. ||| manb4war says: ""If you earn a lot of money you should pay more in taxes not less.""

But that doesn't address the question I asked.  You are not approaching the issue logically but emotionally.  For whatever reason you appear to dislike wealth.  

Again, and think logically, where to your tax dollars go?  Not where you think they should go.  But really, where does all of that income end up? ||| Just like James Madison you want the state to be 'so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.'
So you can drop all this talk of liberty or equality or free markets. ||| ""it`s a good idea to live off of other peoples labour"" - I didn't know that factories and farms and workplaces were suddenly being managed by the people who work in them. Oh wait they're not, the workers are wage slaves who sell themselves to the owners. ||| oh very cute, cast it as protecting a minority and none will be the wiser, no. ||| flat tax benefits the rich, progressive taxation is the key ||| a free market can only work in total equality. Now does that sound like the USA with its vast gap between the wealthy and the poor? the talk of fre market we see is merely a means of transfering state power into the hands of private unaccountable tyranies ||| and why should someone inherit wealth they did not earn? ||| except for a minority that has been turned into mindless randroids by corporate propaganda, the general population generally thinks its a good idea to do something about a poor child getting an education and so on, now you raise a tactical issue about how the money is used and true enough that ought to be a democratic decision made by the community ||| there is when you manipulate the state to protect your wealth from the masses ||| HEY!

-The Dystopian book 1984 made people aware that governments can be full of bs without them realizing it.

Starring: Liam Neeson, James Nesbitt, Anamaria Marinca

Lurgan Northern Ireland, 1975. A low level civil war has been underway, with the IRA targeting British loyalists and the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force exacting revenge on Catholics they claim are militant republicans. Alistair Little, 16 is the leader of a UVF cell, eager to be blooded. He and his gang are given the go ahead to kill a young Catholic man, James Griffin, as a reprisal and a warning to others. When the hit is carried out, Joe Griffin - the 11-year old little brother of the target - watches in horror his brother is shot in the head. Thirty years later Joe Griffin and Alistair are to meet, on camera, with a view to reconciliation. Alistair has served his sentence, and peace may have been agreed to in N. Ireland, but Joe Griffin is not coming on the program for a handshake.

After his brother's murder I believe one of Joe's siblings took his own life and both his parents died quite young so he lost his entire family.

Nikos, Greece ||| This was filmed in my mother's home town, in fact my grandmother was an extra in the movie, she was in the train scene :) ||| Except in this one, it's a child. ||| lol i also had the priviledge to meet james nesbitt and rupert grint got a picture taken with them, when they were in the rotterdam belfast its a bar and they were doing a public thing for the release of cherry bomb i think. ||| true! ||| i guess you havent watch star wars ||| That was sarcasm. Good job. ||| I actually met liam neeson when he was filming this as it was filmed round the corner from my house, i was in the snooker club and he knocked on the door needed to use the toilet was nice enough and signed an autograph for me. ||| There were numerous evils done on behalf of both sides of the conflict; don't kid yourself. ||| How ironic, you are acting like if the church hasn't killed innocents all these years. ||| The song is requiem in the minor.... and yes it is Mozart ! =) ||| ""Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.""

For the Irish Catholics who been persecuted by Protestant militants. May the Lord Jesus bless them to Our Catholic Faith! Amen! ||| watched it last night. Great film.Made me cry. Nikos Greece-Scotland ||| Is your comment supposed to make any sense? ||| Oh yeah let this nutter represent America because that is a fair and unbiased statement. ""Hello I'm Pot. You must be kettle. I'm just here to say that you are black""- AfrikaanPrincess ||| Sorry mate, but the fuck are you on about? ||| As an Irish Catholic living down under, i dont have strong credibility to comment on the political nature of this film.  But can I say respectfully to all of us, it raises a great concept of remorse and the ability to forgive for the sake of moving forward - on both sides of the equation.  There is a long way to go and I hope Ireland will be united again where her children can all live together in peace - not fairytale shite, but get along with each other and no more carnage.   I wish u well. ||| it's kinda boring but was good

but what a lame movie !!! ||| CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE PIECE THATS BEING PLAYED IN THIS TRAILER ||| Great movie! ||| I friggin' love this movie.   ||| @ProCorona dude he is not underated at all...everyone in the movie business knows who he is and how much talented he is.and he made a bunch of films which he get a lot of recognizion....and well shcindler list...he is amazing period ||| 1:40 To save the planet I'll have to become Superman 4 the quest for peace  ||| @notsoginger I know Liam Neeson is Catholic,i am from the same country as him! ||| Good movie,is underrated ||| @baghdadi18 this movie is not a hollywood movie ,is a british movie ||| @niloh96 its so hard to pin point the frame, it was the face Nesbitt made when he says ""OR DO I KILL HIM!"" btw i have watched this since my original comment, its a very small story but very good acting from James Nesbitt and its nice to see Liam Neeson doing his 'proper' accent :P I should also point out that Neeson is Catholic in real life and Nesbitt is Presbyterian, whereas in this film they have opposite backgrounds. Its a very neutral sided film in terms of sectarianism. ||| @notsoginger Whats so funny?
''Life of Riley''? ||| 1:28 lol ||| @baghdadi18 i actually atheist, but theres something about the jewish (or perhaps just the way theyre portrayed in movies?) that makes them so lovable.  ||| @Countrygent100 well, don't let it get to you too much, sitting on top of that much oil has turned much of the middle east into a war torn shit hole. given the choice i'd go with movies.

I want to watch this now. ||| Der Film ist total scheiße!!! ||| Is that Beethoven? ||| @HIS7ORYS7AR really cool how do you become an extra? ||| @mcginlm72 I'm from Finland. ;) And as you may have noticed, I was joking.  ||| @Monaqute That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen written! there is no such thing as a European Accent!!! Europe is made up of 47 different countries (last count!) are you trying to say that the French, English,Scottish & Irish to name a small few all have the same accent!?!?! In Ireland alone you can wander from town to town, village to city and every single place will have it's own variant of the Northern Irish accent.  Where may I ask are you from to show such ignorance?? ||| @Monaqute there is no such thing as a European Accent, Europe is made up of 47 countries (last count) each country has it's own accent in Ireland alone you can travel from town to town and each will have it's own accent slightly different from the next - this has to be the most ridiculous statement I think anyone has ever written - where may I ask are you from to be so ignorant?? ||| @Pedowfyl Both James Nesbitt and Liam Neeson are from Northern Ireland they are from Ballymena, Co Antrim  I would same Liam Neeson's accent has watered down over the years but James still talks pretty much like a bloke just off the boat from Ireland.  ||| @mcginlm72 I'm not glorifying anything, just giving you an idea of why they might think this way ||| @mcginlm72 a lot of americans are of irish descent and have supported the IRA for decades as they not only represent a cultural and genetic link to the country but they're shown as freedom fighters. It's like the age old adage 'One country's terrorist is another country's freedom fighter' ||| I'm half Irish and grew up in Northern Ireland in the height of the troubles and am continually sicken by the movie industries glorification of it all, mostly by stupid American's that think somehow these murderers are martyrs and heroes!! anyone who lived and grew up in this world will tell you a very different story - I love James Nesbitt he is a fantastic actor I'd love to think them being Irish would mean the film is worth viewing but Liam Neeson did Michael Collins and that was pish!  ||| Ulster dudes are UK puppets!!!!!! ||| This movie was ok,but the ending was kind of fucked up,there are better movies about northern ireland such as in the name of the father and 50 dead men walking ||| @JesseReith1 im glad someone found a different feeling when watching this movie i dont know where you are from but real life in northern ireland is and can be just like this for some my nephew was murdered 10 years ago and i still struggle to keep my sanity .my sister in law said that she would rather be the mother of the victim than the mother of a killer. now thats the real truth about the troubles here.i wish you well who ever you are and remember god loves all religions not just one ||| im from northern ireland and have been effected by murder in my family and the companies making these movies never tell the truth and the hurt felt by the victims families but like to portray the murderers as some kind of heroes im sick listening to people telling of the human rights of all involved in the conflict when if you knowingly leave your home irrispective of which group you belong to and knowingly go out to kill or mame you should give up all rights to justice and compassion

r_qsRD7IZQw,Gleason (2002),"Clip Of Brad Garrett as Jackie Gleason Doing part of a Honeymooners skit. 
You should see this movie if you have not.",movie,67599.0,690.0,227,PT4M3S,"Brad Garrett was born to play Jackie Gleason ||| The Gleason ""slow burn"" was spot on. ||| This was really well done. ||| I'm impressed they managed to make a 6'8"" man look normal sized. Also I can't imagine anyone better than Brad Garrett to play Jackie Gleason. ||| When Brad was on Everybody Loves Raymond, he often did things that reminded me of Jackie Gleason. He was the perfect choice to play him in this. ||| Brad is like a foot taller than the late Gleason. Amazing he could pass as 5’9” in this film. ||| Wow, that was a great portrayal! ||| Why couldn't they stick to the original dialogue? ||| That guy iiiissss Norton!!! Aaahhh! ||| Way too tall but great in the part. ||| All 3 actors absolutely nailed it! I thought I was watching a real Honeymooners episode! ||| 😔~RIP Joyce Randolph~😔 ||| This is from the 2002 film ""Gleason"". This is some of the best casting I have ever seen! Brad Garrett was amazing! The actor playing Art Carney is Michael Chieffo.  He is married to Beth Grant. Kristin Dalton played Audrey Meadows. Perfect casting all around! ||| Excellent movie! One thing, though, I had heard when filming, the actors had to wear strange color clothes, like green clothes and pink shirts so they would appear correctly on black and white film. The studio audience would see this, but on TV no one was the wiser. ||| Alice was bad but everything else is pretty good ||| Great job.  All characters well cast. ||| Terrible. Rushed like they were double parked. ||| Fantastic performances by this cast! They obviously studied all the body language and timing of the characters. ||| I never thought it was funny??? ||| Phenomenal.  Garrett even has the mannerisms down! ||| Great effort! ||| this was the worst thing i ever saw brad garret wasnt even close to what jackie gleason was , ||| ""Hello ball...."" ||| I like how in the original pilot episode, Art Carney was a policeman and not a plumber, and I think his name was not ""Ed Norton"". ||| @ 2:30  A goof.... Jackie was supposed to turn around before he screamed (at Ed's space getup). ||| Awful. Just. goes to show us:  You can’t go back.   NO ONE can come close to that original show.. no one . . ||| The attempted Gleason imitation is weak.....the timing and the vocals way off. ||| The guy that played art Carney was spot on. Like wow.... Looks just like him. Talks like him. Moves like him. Amazing ||| If Brad Garrett was 9 inches shorter he could have passed for Jackie Gleason.  At 6' 8 1/2 tall his height was so noticeable, but he had Gleason down perfectly!  Brad Garrett is one funny guy and is a good actor too.  I will have to watch this movie for sure. The guy playing Norton was pretty good too, as were the two ladies.  ||| This was amazing! ||| Honeymooners and odd couple, two of the best sitcom's ever ||| Brad played Jackie part very well I mean very well rest in peace to the great one Jackie Gleason 🙏🕊️ ||| impossible to imitate the originals.  I can't watch this ||| One error. The front door opens the wrong direction. ||| This is my favorite episode.... ||| A poor imitation of what was a classic show. ||| The Honeymooners, the best sitcom ever there was.... ||| EVEN DURING EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND you could see the huge influence Gleason had on Brad....Bravo!!! ||| This is really good but why did they use the wrong music? Copyrights? ||| Without a doubt, the greatest sit com ever... ||| Too tall ||| He sucks as Jackie Gleason but Art Carney came back from the dead for this ||| The guy playing Ralph and the Alice rushed their lines, he also didn't really have his moves down. Norton's actor was great though ||| What movie is this ||| Can't believe that wasn't actually Jackie and Art Carney! It was like having them back with us again. Fabulous!!! ||| Whenever they try to recreate scenes like this it doesn’t work for me. I have this movie and it’s ok. ||| I MUST OF WATCHED THIS CLIP 100 TIMES ||| GREAT MEMORIES .THANKS
ACTORS DID A GREAT JOB
EVANGELIST ROGER MANSOUR
MISSIONARY TO 🇭🇹 HAITI ||| Great 👍 ||| Brad Garrett stinks. ||| I always thought Brad Garrett looked like Gleason & apparently so do alot of other people, I never knew this existed until today ||| Great job ||| I can’t believe how good this is. ||| Everything great, but the drumset sounds like about 2005, not 1955, sorry, I got an ear : ) ||| They weren't able to get the music? ||| Where can you see the movie ||| Robert was wayyyy too tall to play Jackie ||| If they were going to imitate one of the Honeymooners episodes for this movie, they at least could have got the shows theme song correct.  This one is TOTALLY wrong! ||| I forgot all about this....I thought it was well done. ||| They were all spot on! My favorite show ever! Honeymooners never gets Old 💯👍 ||| did any of the principal characters every watch any episode from the 15 minute skits or the 39 episodes...this was like the Bud and Lou movie they made in the 70s... ||| If that would have been a real apartment it would be a gloomy dump. ||| This has got to be the WORST ACTING I've ever seen. ||| Given as old as this post is I'm pretty sure most of the people in the comments have seen the 2002 movie this segment was pulled from however I'm going to just leave this here for newcomers 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqdYRviytY8 ||| The actor doing Norton was dead on! ||| Original actors was only 1,000.000% better !!! ||| The two male actors are spot on. This is great. Thanks for sharing. ||| Best thing I own is an autographed Honeymooners Audrey Meadows comic book ||| Doorknob should be on left side ||| They couldn't get rights to the original theme? ||| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqdYRviytY8 ||| ❤️ ||| The actor playing Art Carney is unreal ||| Thanks for posting. This is amazing. ||| My mother said her father took her to see the show in New York City when she was little. Live Honeymooners. Awesome. ||| Surreal. But funny. LOL I love how they keep switching from color to broadcast black and white. Clever. ||| NOW THIS IS  FUNNY  🍷😁 ||| I would have Christina Hendricks as Alice Kramden. What a busty beauty! ||| They could have used the original script. ||| That looks like Ed Norton in his 20s with all that hair. Maybe those sewer gases disintegrated his hair. 😄 ||| Brett Garret is excellent, ||| great fun!! Carney actor is spot on!! ||| There was a movie 🎥 of this made in 2002? Must have been made for TV and that’s how I missed it. ||| other then the fact that the real Gleason was a bit shorter then Carney, for a giant they all done a great job. ||| She aced it. ||| Didn’t stay true to original script which make it weak ... ||| The full movie is great!💯 ||| Brad Garrett is spot on as Jackie Gleason he even gets his mannerisms spot on. ||| The laugh track doesn't quite jive with the dialogue. ||| Wow!!! What an excellent job Brad did!!! ||| Fun Fact:  $75 in 1953 is $720 today. ||| Never heard of this. I have to find it. ||| Nice! ||| It's very difficult to portray such an iconic character. He did an ok job. Someone like Kevin James would have been better. ||| That doesn't sound like The Honeymooners theme. ||| I rember back when this movie aired on CBS on a Sunday night. I was supposed to start at 9:00 but CBS showed a football game which ran late so it didn't start until after9:30. ||| Brad Garrett is 6'9. Alice must be almost 6'3. ||| Brad is wonderful ||| They could have at least watched the original episode in order to try and get the same energy ! This was lackluster performance, bordering on lame. Ralph looked bored, Alice's timing was off, Norton was too straight, not goofy enough. ||| Perfect match for Art Carney",0.0320563194173155,0.9863290190696716,3,1,0.03,100

Der 36-jährige Marc (Hanno Koffler) hat sich sein Leben gut eingerichtet. Er ist bei der Bereitschaftspolizei und hat dort gute Karriereaussichten, er hat die Doppelhaushälfte der Eltern vorfinanziert und zudem wird er bald auch noch Vater. Doch dann geschieht das Undenkbare - er verliebt sich auf einer Fortbildung in seinen Kollegen Kay (Max Riemelt).

Mit aller Macht versucht er, dagegen anzukämpfen und seine Gefühle geheim zu halten. In seinem Arbeitsumfeld bei der Polizei herrscht nach wie vor ein maskulines Rollenbild und er fürchtet sich vor den Reaktionen seines Umfelds, seiner Freunde, seiner Familie. Sein Leben gleitet ihm zunehmend aus der Hand, als er zwischen seiner vertrauten Welt und dem Rausch der neuen Erfahrungen hin- und hergerissen wird und sich einfach kein Ausweg aus diesem Dilemma zu bieten scheint.

I want so badly to see ..can anyone tell me please ... 😊😊😊 ||| I don't know the language, I didn't really know whats going on, but I found boxxy software - and watch it with english subtitles. ||| we are full of sissies ||| Still one of my all-time favourites.
The chemistry between these two amazing actors is over the moon and the whole story is so real and beautifully acted out.
Oh I am so excited for part two. ||| Gänsehaut ||| Wer Wunder sich auch das hir keine deutschen drunter schreiben ||| does anyone know if the director of this is straight. I think so because  the first sex scene didn't seem realistic.  in my experience,  that's not what closeted married gay men want on their first gay experience. ||| Ich habe mir gerade den Film zum ersten mal angesehen. Meiner Meinung nach erzählt er die Geschichte sehr authentisch, aber: (minimale spoiler)
Ein tragendes Thema des Films ist der Zwiespalt des Protagonisten, einen Mann zu lieben obwohl er (s)eine Frau liebt. Auch die Frau macht den Zwiespalt deutlich als sie auf seine Aussage, nicht schwul zu sein, ""was bist du dann?"" schreit. Die Antwort ""Bisexuell"" fällt dem Protagonisten im ganzen Film nicht ein, was mich beim schauen fast wütend gemacht hat, denn diese Erkenntnis hätte so vieles einfacher gemacht. Ich hoffe noch auf die Fortsetzung, vielleicht wird es da zur Sprache gebracht. Bi-Akzeptanz nach Brokeback Mountain Manier wäre schön :) ||| Free Fall 2 is on its way. They need our support though. Go to

to make the movie happen and donate as much as you can. :) ||| I just saw this movie yesterday and I fell in love with the history of these two, very realistic and sad, I want a second part to see them happy :( ||| der trailer lässt den film richtig lahm wirken obwohl der richtig gut ist! schaut euch lieber die lana del rey-free Fall Videos an, die sind nice! ||| so koffler is a gay? ||| This movie was so relatable, and realistic and sad. 😭❤️ ||| Cooles Video ||| this is absolutely beautiful...i'm watching this movie over and over again...
This is all i need for life. And a mattress, a blanket and pillows. ||| I wanna watch this! ||| Ich musste so weinen, weil dieser Film einfach so schön ist. Ich komm echt nicht drauf klar. noch nie hat mich so ein Film berührt. ||| Waiting for Part II where its more about Marc + Kay! 😏✌🏼️ ||| Klasse es Thema . Liebe kann so brutal und schön  sein . ||| Dieser Film ist einfach nur wundervoll, so viel Gefühl, Hingabe und Schmerz... ich freue mich wahninnig auf einen zweiten Teil :)))♥ ||| Kay is Jack Twist and Marc is Ennis del Mar. ||| Wolfgang 😘😘 ||| Was fürn geiles Timing man, ich seh den heut zum ersten Mal, find ihn supergut, nach dem Ende voll traurig danach gegoogelt.. erster Treffer: Fortsetzung angekündigt.. vor zwei Tagen :D ||| Everybody like this facebook page so we'll be able to see Kay and Marc in love AGAIN!! :)
They plan on making a second part of Freier Fall/ Free Fall but they need our support.

They just need enough supporters and money (crowdfunding campaign). You can like the site of ""Free Fall 2"" here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-Fall-2-Freier-Fall-2/1553203491595933?fref=nf Please spread the word! :) ||| IM SCREAMING I LOVE THEM SO MUCH  ||| Film Rating: 9/10 The chemistry was great, and the plot was amazing. But I do feel as if Kay's feelings were sidelined the whole screening, he loved Marc. The ending was what really got to me, where Kay left basically disappearing. It was so heartbreaking an sad at the same time. Why end the movie the way it did without revealing a sequel where Marc goes after Kay? The ending was so suspicious and open it looked perfect for a sequel to pick up. Question is how would Marc find Kay if he didnt leave anything behind? Kay was very close with ""Britt"" the girl on the force team, who knew about Marc and Kay's affair, I'm sure he informed her about where is went... (Common knowledge). ||| Nach BBM das beste was es in letzter Zeit zu dem Thema gegeben hat. Was die beiden Hauptdarsteller alles ausdrücken nur mit ihrer Mimik und Gestik ist grandios...ganz großes Gefühlskino..starke Leistung von Koffler und Riemelt..ebenso von Katharina Schüttler. ||| just finished watching this. This makes me sad. I didn't cry but It's like I feel what the guy is going through. ||| Ich hab einfach die ganze Zeit gehofft, dass der Film nicht zu Ende geht. Ich hab mitgelitten und mitgefiebert. Super Film! ||| ist Irgendjemand von den beiden Schauspielern privat Schwul ?? ||| Super Film, hab ihn schon gesehen! Sehr realistisch und lebensnah. Sehr gute Arbeit! Danach hat man guten Stoff zum nachdenken! ||| Max Riemelt is hot :) ||| Warum sind hier eigentlich so viele englische Kommentare? :O
Und ist das ein deutscher Film? ||| Warum sind hier eigentlich so viele englische Kommentare? :O
Und ist das ein deutscher Film? ||| Dieser Film ist alles, was ich je in meinem Leben brauchen werde ||| brokeback mountain auf deutsch!?? ||| Wow...der ist echt....geil aber auch traurig .... Bisschen scheiß Ende :((( *schnief* 
 ||| does anyone know where i can see this movie free online ? ||| It's not like Brokeback Mountain -_-
I love it... my favorite movie for long long time :3
With my amazing deutsch i didn't really know whats going on, but *ich liebe es* :DD
Uhm, I cried, you know... ||| Recién termine de verla y me encanto, me gusto mucho!c: ||| Ótimo filme! ||| is there a link anywhere online for the movie?? I cant seem to find it anywhere :( ||| Toller Film !:) ||| Ist die Handlung vorhersehbar? Ja, ist sie. Sind die Dialoge vorhersehbar? Ja, sind sie. Macht das irgendwas aus? Nein, tut es nicht. Ein wunderschöner Film, getragen von Hanno Koffler und Max Riemelt, zum immer wieder anschauen. ||| when i first saw the trailer, i also thought it looks so Brokeback Mountain...but now i saw the movie and its different!! Its a very good movie, Watch it!!!! ||| 0.33-0.36 Wow! Mit Max Riemelt würd ich auch gern mal was rauchen... ||| Brokeback Polizeirevier
 ||| Parece ser ótimo. :) ||| aber nur wenn er seinen berliner dialekt im griff hat. toller schauspieler, aber wenn der einen von der bayrischen bergwacht spielt und ich immer das gefühl habe, dass ist eine defa produktion, sollte man sich als schauspieler mal mit seiner aussprache beschäftigen...
 ||| ไม่ชอบ ||| So basically this is Brokeback Moutain but their cops instead of cowboys. ||| Nach dem Titel ""Freier Fall"" dachte ich erst das wird ein Film über Felix Baumgärtner ^^ ||| Does anyone know the song playing during the ending credits? ||| Ich find schwule echt in ordnung ||| Does anyone know when this movie will be released on DVD internationally/w. English subtitles? I need to see it!  ||| Der Mann ist nicht egoistisch er versucht nur glücklich zu werden. Wenn er schwul ist, wird die Frau auf Dauer auch nicht glücklich mit ihm werden, denn sie wird irgendwann eh merken, dass er sie nicht wirklich lieben kann. Scheidung ist immer scheiße aber besser früh als zu spät oder? ||| It's funny to see so many english comments here! :D Do people from the us really watch german movies? Sorry for my prejudices but I didn't know that. :P ||| Dass es echt immer noch so viele gibt, die was gegen schwule haben... :( ||| No entiendo nada, pero me encantaria verla entendiendo :( ||| Süß... <3 :)  ||| Bleib bei der Frau bitte,bitte!!!! ||| schaut spannend aus.. ||| die deutsche Version von brokeback mountain ... ||| OMG... ||| Das ist ein Film! O_o
Das Nachmittagsprogramm bei RTL zeigt ja zum Glück auch das reale Leben ;D ||| Dümmer gehts immer.  ||| Die arme Frau, betrogen zu werden ist echt hart. Wieder ein Scheidungskind. wenn man ein kind erzeugt hat, dann solllte man auch nicht egoistisch sein und an das eigenr Blut denken!. ||| Brokeback Mountain = DEUTSCH =) will aber trotzdem schauen ;) ||| Mich würd mal die Altersbeschränkung interessierne, aber der viel ist bestimmt super... ||| Und selbst wenn wir krank sind, ich hab das Gefühl wir sind um einiges glücklicher als du ;) ||| Filme mit Max Riemelt MUSS man sehen, egal um was es geht.  ||| wo? ||| Unheimlich widerlich und mir tun alle beteiligten Leid! Schwul sein wird euch von den Medien diktiert, ihr seid krank. Sorry ||| Unheimlich widerlich und mir tun alle beteiligten Leid! ||| EIn toller Film. Wow. Habe ihn heute gesehen, und würde ihn am besten morgen wieder  sehen. ||| das geht ja mal garnicht!!! leider gibt es so welche wie dich zu oft auf der welt !! lass doch jeder so sein wie er will...... lass sie doch einfach dass sein was sie wollen  ||| Tolle Thematik! Und Max Riemelt ist sowieso *_* <3 ||| Ohh man den möchte ich sehen der Trailer sieht echt gut aus :D ||| naja nicht so mein Geschmack ||| I so wanna see this NOW :) 
 ||| Pues como que se parece mucho a CONTRACORRIENTE
Pero todas las películas gay valen la pena ||| :`(
 ||| It's already out in germany but I have no idea when it will be released in the us. ||| ;-)
 ||| Sehr guter Film...
 ||| Genau das hab ich mir auch gedacht, mit Brokeback Mountain und so. Sieht aber recht sehenswert aus :)  ||| Happy End für die Jungs , oder die Frau ?

 ||| Max Riemelt ist heiß :) ||| Hab´s rausgefunden: 
Goldene Palme von Cannes geht an ""La vie d'Adèle""

The scenes up to the 15th  sec of your clip are not there and the love scene has not been so revealing in the movie theatre.  The film was great but on 3 occassions I saw the boom micrphone enter the screen! And it makes me wonder, were we shown a non final cut?

Мир, в котором автор вложил всю прожитую юную жизнь, в затемневшей комнате, окна которые были набиты кирпичами, да и общество, как и всегда, не принимали его за человека, который в будущем перевернет всю киноиндустрию мрачными, но к тому же обобаятельными и жизненными моралями ||| His aunt has the body of bobs mom from Frankenweenie ||| Easily one of my favorite stop motion designs along with Laika’s stop motion.

mEwfS8veJxE,Shall We Dance?,"Golden Globe winner Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez step out in a delightfully sexy comedy with a sizzling all-star cast! John Clark is a meek workaholic who feels trapped in a dull, mindnumbing existence. But one night, his whole life changes when the sight of a beautiful dance instructor (Lopez) inspires him to break out of his mold and sign up for some fancy footwork- if he expects to keep his exciting new passion a secret from his family and friends. Also starring Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci!",dance,,25296.0,1453,PT1H46M28S,"What an amazing movie! so well balanced in every aspect, in dance rhythms, purity and genuineness!

I love that he choose his wife first then brought her to the party and still had fun with his friends. ||| Not nearly as good as the original Japanese move it's based on. Loses a lot of the charm and misses the point with many of the characters. Several unneeded crude interactions. ||| Jennifer Lopez was great in this movie. And so pretty. ||| One of y favorites 🥰🥰 ||| Richard Gere is alive and 75 years old. ||| Ditto here!! 😂😂 ||| Good movie ||| I’ve seen this movie before. But I had forgotten the details.

Definitely. Also, He stopped dancing when his Wife was there supporting him? Blatantly discluding her....again. Yuck.What an emotional child.

I have a soft spot for Buck Henry -- good seeing him here. He reminds me a little of Wally Cox. They were both highly intelligent guys. ||| One of my very favorite movies of all me-time. Makes me cry a little every time. ||| Works on many levels 😊 ||| So even back in the seventies they gave the whole story away in the trailer. ||| RIP Joe its been a rough 2 weeks since you've been gone.

Their belief is to physically terminate gays, Hindus, Buddhist and anyone who leaves Islamic religion. Islam is satanic, you need to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and God, And you and nation will have true peace. Also their prophet Mohammed  is a child molester. he has sex with a 9 year old girl and he and his followers thought it was ok, very sick people.,, the Mayor of deerborn Michigan was so disrespectful to Biden and Trump because the mayor doesn't care about America because he is a Muslim.
Aisha, was 9 years old Muhammad the prophet was fifty six years old  and when He had intercourse with  her  (Wives of the Prophet, pages 57-61 ||| Michael Jackson did a song by the same title of this movie ||| I wanted to send a encouraging message & I'll do my best to get wisdom with humbleness and Truth and Love. This is a good movie but it's nothing compared to what heaven really looks like. About 8 years ago I got sick with a late-stage chronic lyme disease and even though I'm still suffering today with a quite a few issues Lyme disease gave me mild to moderate chronic pancreatitis. I had to get three bone marrow biopsies done through the past 3 years and finding out by my blood doctor that I have a few less cells in my bone marrow currently at 20% to 25% and it should be at 70% for my age. Everyday I deal with chronic gut issues fatigue and lack of interest. Bright lights bother me everyday so when I look at my phone or my tablet I have to turn the light all the way down. But through all the difficulties in trials and tribulations that I'm going through I'm learning a lot through my suffering. First I thought God doesn't care about me if he cared about me he wouldn't let me suffer like this. But the more I learn of the Lord's character through Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior to the holy Spirit one God three different persons working together with one another in harmony. The more I learned the Lord's character and his goodness and grace and mercy and love and holiness. The more I want to walk with him and to obey him for the right reasons not for me to get saved by good works but what he did for me and many on the cross that accept and I believe in God through Jesus Christ as Lord and savior. I'm not talking about a religion I'm talking about a relationship. I started searching for truth and meaning of life and I knew God exists but I didn't know the one and only true God that stretched the heavens like a tent. I started doing my research and studying all these Faith religions and all of them didn't make sense and didn't add up to me. Because I told myself there can't be too gods or multiple gods are hundreds of gods but only one God that created everything that we see from the heavens and from Earth. The one and only true God from the 66 books of the Torah Hebrew Bible translated into the English Bible in many different languages that God will preserve his word and keep it safe he had a plan of salvation from the beginning of time before he created Earth. God is love through Jesus Christ he is kind and patient towards us every day and he forgives us and gives us Grace upon us every day that we don't deserve. The Lord is holy and just and sobbing over all things. There is in heaven and hell but more and more people don't want to believe that God created the hell. but if God didn't create hell he wouldn't be God and who he is because all the bad people that done wicked things like murdering people and committing sexual rape or child molesting then these people won't get punished at all. But God must be a just judge and judge righteously. God is always wooing his love towards unbelievers everyday getting their attention. JOHN 3:16 TIM TEBOW...✍️✝️🇺🇲🫶♥️ ||| March 20, 2025.

THIS IS ONE OF THEM. ||| Very romantic 😍 💕 I could have played Warren's role ...give me six months prep ||| In 1978 I was just becoming conscious of who I am and what the would was.

How can they make the movie look so awful? ||| 70's and films 🎥 🫂 ||| Lightness, but dramatically excellent as well ||| This film jinxed the Rams in Super Bowl XIV. 😄 Anyway, let's go Rams! 🐏 ||| Never heard of this and it was on cable a few years ago and I started watching and I was just drawn in by Warren Beatty's performance. The way he is so energetic about his situation and so chill about how there's a few people trying to murder him really drew me in. I'll have to see this again. ||| My Parents love this movie. ||| wow he's still supposed to be alive!!! lol ||| I’ve never seen this film but the plot seems like from the movie Down to Earth with Chris Rock? ||| Utter cr#p....unfortunately..one of the stvpidest concepts ever filmed...let alone 4 times (if you include the sequel to the original). ||| March 28 2025?

Imagine if Beatty does really go on that day 😳 ||| 💚🧡💫💜💞 ||| I bet Warren Beatty wanted to go Will Smith on Chris Rock in 2001. ||| I must have seen this 5 times in the theater. Wonderful, romantic popcorn movie from my teen years. ||| I think this movie is about to trend ||| Comes Mr. Jordan ||| That was a great movie ||| The fact that this 1970s film mentions 2025 ||| BBC 1 fault brought me here. ||| If Warren Beatty dies on March 20th 2025, I'm going to start going to church. ||| Wow Ben Stiller looked so old here lol ||| Great movie. ||| When you get tired of superhero movies ""Heaven Can Wait"" is a nice break from films about cities being destroyed again and again by overpowered villains who really are just lonely and need a romantic partner and alien civilizations that invade Earth because nobody on their planet ever invented Taco Tuesdays. ||| LOVE THIS MOVIE!!

Before I Disappear Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Emmy Rossum, Paul Wesley Movie HD

A troubled young man and his straight-laced niece embark on a thrilling odyssey through New York City in this heartrending drama based on an Oscar-winning short. As his life hits rock bottom, 20-something Richie (Shawn Christensen) decides to end it all—only to have his half-hearted suicide attempt interrupted by an urgent request from his sister (Emmy Rossum) to babysit her precocious daughter (Fatima Ptacek). So begins a madcap tour of Manhattan after dark, as uncle and niece find unexpected bonds in the unlikeliest of places. Ron Perlman co-stars in this hugely moving adaptation of up-and-coming director/star Christensen's own 2013 Academy Award-winning short, Curfew.",movie,2175168.0,14443.0,464,PT2M27S,"One of the best films i have ever seen!

Extraterrestrial Official Teaser Trailer 1 (2014) - Freddie Stroma Sci-Fi Horror Movie HD

On VOD October 17. In Theaters November 21.

From The Vicious Brothers, the creators of Grave Encounters comes a different kind of encounter, one of 'EXTRATERRESTRIAL' origin.
Still reeling from her parents divorce, April (Brittany Allen) is dragged back to the vacation cabin she spent fond summers at as a child accompanied by a group of friends. Her trip down memory lane takes a dramatic and terrifying turn when a fireball descends from the sky and explodes in the nearby woods. Lead by her boyfriend, played by Freddie Stroma (Harry Potter & The Half Blooded Prince, Pitch Perfect), the group venture out toward the crash site and discover the remnants of a ship from another planet along with footprints that suggest its alien occupants are still alive. The college friends soon find themselves caught in the middle of something bigger and more terrifying than anything they could ever imagine.

Coming on Oct 17 (VOD), Nov 21 (Theatres)
Starring: Brittany Allen, Freddie Stroma, Melanie Papalia, Jesse Moss
Directed by: The Vicious Brothers",movie,474165.0,831.0,213,PT1M53S,"The whole baby aliens hybrid thing needed more explanation ||| MAN THIS MOVIE IS OUT THERE!... ITS VERY GOOD IT KEEPS YOU ON YOUR SEAT?? WELL SORTA, KINDA, NOT REALLY!!! lol 🤪 AT THE END IT REALLY BLOWS YOUR MIND BECAUSE @ TIMES YOU HEAR STORIES JUST LIKE WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THE MOVIE!!! AAND YOU KNOW???... I REALLY BELIEVE ITS JUST LIKE THIS!! JUST SEE IT & HOLD ON TIGHT!!!! BARA BIM BARA BOOM!! 😉 ||| I love this movie 👽 😆 ||| I love all the aliens in this movie especially when she woke up on the ship the first thing she saw was all the  aliens and at the end it didn’t see that coming this movie is a fun and crazy alien movie ||| I love this movie I remember watching this it gave me the chills it’s so awesome best alien movie ever ||| OK where the men in Black at ant the monsters ||| Anyone who says this movie is good, clearly hasn't seen an actually good alien/UFO/extraterrestrial film. I saw the trailer for this, thought it looked interesting, went to sit and watch the film....it's just crap, I had to stop myself from falling asleep 3 times on 1 watch.
This was such a boring tedious slog to sit through, and you can have an alien film be slow without being boring or pretentious (watch fire in the sky)
Or even an alien film that's not great and a little pretentious (the fourth kind, also a bad film, but for different circumstances, and will at least leave a lasting impression after watching) (or go watch VHS 2) there's a scene that has stuck with me for years after seeing that{train horn*) this isn't a good or even decent, I honestly completely forgotten about it until I came across this trailer again. ||| Best trailer ||| I couldn't stop laughing when I 1st saw the probing scene. It's like you expected from every alien encounter they have to harvest their farts somehow. Maybe methane is their ship fuel source. ||| there is a clip for this film on my channe ||| Hands up 👍up ||| My 1st thought 💭 after seeing the explosion 💥 was evacuate with the promptness beyond human possibilities...if that wasn’t soon enough the spaceship and soon after the  footprints 👣 I would have gotten out of there with extreme urgency..forget the personal belongings all you will need are your bodies and those d&@“ keys..but noooooo!!!They had to go back and investigate..This was a good 🎥 For me this movie would have been over seconds into the movie 
The decision to go into these woods would not have happened... 🍿
->The ending!!Are you serious.... ||| This went from horror to comedy. ||| Watching it now and it’s pretty good ! ||| Cool ||| No ||| Pio ||| I will give this movie cred- it did give me a scene where an asshole dies as an asshole should- via anal-probe. ||| In the butt, oooooh ow😅😂😂😂 ||| sad life ||| trailer good .


..movie....? ||| I like Alien movies and I actually like this movie. If you watch the end of the movie they actully did something our goverment would do if we found out the truth and that was more scary and sad. ||| #Getprobed ||| 1:45 Prob bugs Prob bugs watcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do when they come for your ass 
XD ||| I love Aliens movies ||| just watched it on netflix ||| Seth didn't deserve what happened to him ||| This movie was a good movie but the end just made me mad those f*ing pigs (military) killed them then burned their bodies and made up a story.. ||| I expected this to be a typical mediocre B movie, but apparently I set my standards too high. The whole time you're questioning everyone's actions because all of the characters are fucking stupid. The aliens are incredibly incompetent and their behavior is not indicative of them coming from an intelligent race that traveled light years to reach our planet. They ruin the scare factor by literally showing a full body shot of one of the extra-terrestrials right off the bat.
The acting wasn't much better either; the red head bitch was always smiling in scenes where she was supposed to be terrified. There were several scenes where I found myself saying ""Is that REALLY the best take that they got?""
This movie was a fucking disaster; it's not even worth watching if you just want a scary popcorn flick. It's not scary at all. Just in case they didn't scare you with their cheap jump scares, they add in a disgusting scene at the end, reminiscent of Fire in the Sky, complete with a violent anal probing and a human-alien hybrid.
Sorry, I just hated this movie so much that I had to type this out. It had zero redeeming qualities. lol ||| DUKE NUKEM FOREVER !!! ||| he love to get stick up his asshole  at 1:46 ||| I am Gona say but the movie ending made me cry so FUckin  hard so Dramatic ending maybe that movie as love story Rocks over Twiilight Movie Just sayin my opinion but the movie is not that bad Iv seen worst ! ||| i thought this movie is similar with skyline ||| Good movie the anal probe scen was scary. ||| I'm bored, but not this bored... ||| How many times do they rip off the BAAANNNGGGG-sound from Prometheus? I counted 5 then got bored. ||| god i miss hellraiser and lord of the wishes franchises... ||| Ok Ok..I think ppl hates aliens just because when they think about them the first thing they get to there minds ARE ANAL PROBEEE NOOOO... or something like this :D ||| Probe =/= spinning chainsaw blender blades.

(unless it's an Islamic anal probe). ||| the ending was a piece of shit fucking bullshit dafuq i hate who made this movie, it was so sad fuck this SHIT NO ||| Song name????
 ||| Michael Ironside! ||| 👽 ||| best ending ||| I mean the aliens could be us from the future by the changing of the nature( like the supernova of the sun ) ||| if God create aliens, there are good, but if there not than this is a creation of the devil

But a lot of people said that the aliens are use from the future by the chaging of the nature( the human was very advance at that time ) ||| First - rate movie ! ||| i was going to watch it. them i sow the probe and im like....... no ||| Tottaly bad and repetitive ending!! They should of have left the end where they survived and that's it. ||| Has some good bits, has some bad bits, but the ending is perfect - very anti-American ending.
I also loved the fact that in the end credits there's a thank you to ""The Dark Lord Satan""!  I kid you not.  The Canadians have a sense of humour that the Yanks lack. ||| this was awesome ||| Looks pretty good actually. I have been waiting for a good scary UFO/alien abduction movie. ||| someone know what the song play in 52:35 minuts? ||| the reticulians are comin ta getcha all ||| i watched it one week ago and the movie impresed me so much that i had to watch it again.
Awesome job guys (Y) ||| another Bay's movie trailer? ||| Ce film est trop spécial,le meilleur dans son domaine!!! ||| 1:43 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ||| it was a good movie, one of the best sci-fi horror movies ive seen so far... also, it has a good story behind it. ||| I just saw this movie,it was absolute shite,it was a rip off of a load of other shite movies and they chucked in some 'fire in the sky' in the end,absolute rubbish,nothing worth watching unless you like movies that will keep you believing its going to get good but really it never did,theres some fucking matrix in there towards the end too,well disapointed  ||| Nice ||| why do they always try to make aliens look bad they are probably all friendly  ||| Saw this last night its a very badly thought out plot and is full of Clea Shays its like something a 14 year old would have scripted as well as being anti alien propaganda just like dark skies was.  ||| BWAAAAAAAAAAA..........................BWAAAAAAAAAAAAA ||| If I was an alien I'd be so intergalacticly pissed at this. ||| Yup... Aliens have traveled millions of light years to come to our planet and they have no smarter thing to do, but to put drills in our asses.. -""Its for the science.. We need to know whats your poop made of"".... ||| looks nice- il give it a shot... ||| this movie was terrible, and yes. i DID just come here just to say that. ||| 00:53 lol... that dude totally got alien jizzed on ||| Ok. The get probed thing just kinda ruined for me at the end of the trailer. Now I don't wanna see it cuz that's just nasty! Lmao ||| 1:45 Boobs? ||| download link for the movie ?? I can not find. ||| Oh look! The Smoking Man from x-files in 0:45 ||| probetheus.. ||| The Alien horror I have been waiting for!! ||| 0:43 grenada treaty. Google it ||| 0:24 ""IT WAS A UFOO!!!"" lol ||| ugg, i want a UFO movie thats not over the top crazy with jump scares. ||| ... Well at least Michael Ironside is getting some work.. To bad he ain't in any big budget movies these days. ||| LAME!! SUPER LAME!!  ||| Dudes ass got drilled 1:45...lmao.  ||| THE END !!   ..UFO LIKES ANAL .. I ALWAYS KNEW IT !! ||| Aliens love to stuck something in a man's hole. ||| Greys and reptilians are the only alien species thats malevolent. Hence why you only see movies about abduction including the typical alien (a grey) would be nice to see movie about the federation of light saving us from our reptilian control .. ||| This movie seemed interesting...until that very last line. Now, it seems like its going to be the same old type of abduction movie. ||| That seems horrible. |||  Extraterrestrials are great! the one's looking like us! may be related to us, or we may be related to them.. ancient visitation and manipulation of our evolution, thus the Missing link ||| X-Files remake? That seriously is the entire plot of the X-Files series. They even had the cigarette smoking man!  ||| Muy buena la recomiendo ||| I have the wierdest boner right now. ||| Well on the up side everyone we have a different horror movie subject that isn't zombies or vampires, seriously is anyone sick of The Walking Dead yet? -_-' ||| Too much inception's horns on this trailer ||| It is safe to say that the last guy is quite butthurt after that. ||| illuminati ||| gay ||| in the same genre ""Without Warning""1980 with Jack Palance... ||| Another bullshit evil aliens movie, finally a good alien, thought provoking movie was on its way and what happens, it gets stuck in development hell and Morgan freeman producing it, got in a car accident. And now it's still being shopped around cuz no Hollywood fuckers want to make a peaceful alien movie. A great plot too hopefully someone picks it up ||| another reason why nobody can get good footage of ufos... they probably watch movies like these... and laugh their asses off... ||| Really...? A butt probe? LOL ||| The movie might be promising, but then again, fuck that slow motion sound! In every new fucking movie there's that bullshit, it's annoying, ugh! -.-",0.2288891704377602,0.9967923760414124,20,1,0.2,100
H5p-Q1yuyJE,Dog Pound (2010),"Three juvenile delinquents arrive at a correctional center and are put under the care of an experienced guard.  

An electrifying cast delivers blistering performances packed with intensity and emotional punch that reveals the deficiencies of a well-intentioned but ultimately failing penal system. Kim Chapiron (Sheitan, TFF '06), one of France's brightest emerging directors, lends a contemporary glimpse into how more than 60 percent of the 100,000 children locked away in juvenile detention centers across North America become repeat offenders.

#EPIC ||| Try Scum ||| movie ? ||| Very cool movie, very rough ||| Remake of a england film called scum ||| THE LOCATIJ FOROM FORTNITE ||| The drama of the film is still more or less, but the truth is that if we judge the film from beginning to end it is garbage, especially the ending. I do not understand why they publish films like this and excuse all the actors and all the staff who worked on this film but all their work was for nothing ||| Looks like a copy of scum ||| I saw this a while ago and it was excellent. An honest look at the inside ||| I wanted to know why Bucht went to solitary confinement in the first place because he didn't want to tell who attacked him and why he witnessed Angel's death, whereas in the first situation he was a victim and in the second he Did you have anything to do with the incident, did you just witness it? Does anyone know why? ||| Soundtrack ||| Is this a remake of scum or summat??? ||| and no sexual violence ?? ||| surprisingly effective movie about conditions in lock up. I know it happens in real life but does every prison movie have to have rape in it??? ||| Good movie. You can see different aspects in it. It's terrifying to keep your life safe. 🤟"".. ||| So apparently the guy who played banks killed a guy during a drug transaction and is in prison now. ||| Very similar resemblance to scum 1979 uk film ||| This movie NEEDS a part 2...its was fucken wicked!! But cut short and felt like it didnt even end... ||| Such an amazing film!!! ||| I have been looking for this movie since i watched it about 8 years ago i was convinced it was called doghouse ||| Just watched this film there now.. 01/10/2021..
UNREAL MOVIE!!!;

butch was a great character with depth..
Every young actor played their role amazingly and the violence was actually believable..

Highly recommended this movie!! ||| i liked angel and the 17 year old ||| That was great, I'm going to make you a movie. ||| I cant find on netflix.....can anyone help me out 🤘🤙 ||| Dog Pound (2010) f'u""l'l M'o'V'i""E

He helped out Davis when he was fucked up Nd he cares about his job ||| The revenge beating in the bathroom is truly one of the most brutal scenes in film history. Very satisfying too. ||| One the most realistic juvenile movie of all time... ||| For anyone who aint seen this yet, dont bother, its absolutely shit, its a crap knock off from the original British movie ""scum"" ||| Butch ys de beast ||| Hard movie! ||| Name of the song at the end?? ||| loved this movie man ||| So this is just a remake of Scum? ||| Onde achar completo ||| Full moviee pleaseee ||| So what did happen to Davis??? Stabbed? Slit wrist?? Makes no sense to leave that cliffhanger like that ||| Dónde puede ver la película ||| Wait, how Davis's die? ||| funny thing is,  banks actually played part in a real life murder and is currently serving 5-7 years in prison. ||| quarantine really got me watching all these old movies lol ||| I could've wanted the guard killed. Like stuck up a knife in his throat. This movie is badass ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ||| Song that starts at 0:55 ||| Proper Scum rip off, even down to the ending, just a Yank version of Scum. ||| good movie…. ||| One of my favorite movies ever. Not a happy movie but a movie I can relate with. I seen this for the first time around 6-7 years ago back when it was still on Netflix ||| I still wanna know the song that plays at 0:56 ||| power to the youth ||| So, basically a 'Scum' remake that's half as good? ||| watch here http://kat.tv/watch/pxwY68dz-dog-pound.html ||| I do cecommend ""scum"" 1979 if you enjoyed this. It's a lot darker though. ||| Banks is still in character he's facing up to life in prison for murder ||| Are you looking for Tzu puppies ||| I enjoyed when Butch goes to the fuckboi while the riot ||| the two white guys were on life with Derek lol ||| Soooo sad ... i'm so angry at the ending. :( 
Adam Butcher and Shane Kippel's acting was amazing... ||| Im looking for movies on juvenile delinquency.
Any suggestions?
Thanks!! ||| Just a copy of scum... ||| Hands down definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched. Butch was such a great character ||| Movie sucks IMO.. was about half way through but the acting is so bad i had to turn it off.. what a waste of time ||| This movie is only good if you've been in these scenarios, watching the movie when it first came out was a movie. I never thought I had to live it, so watching it now is a massive wake up call from not going back to hell. so all the scum comments I get it but this movie is such a helping hand for people in this situation. Seriously no one thinks they ever go there but you do ||| The movies amaZing ||| It's total shit. Just a rip off of scum from the 70s with crap acting . ||| Why would I want to watch a bunch of kids fighting in jail lol? ||| Randomly came across this film and watched this trailer first and read some of the comments, thought now I have just finished watching it I'd come back and comment

The film was decent to be fair, and yes, without question it borrowed very heavily from Scum almost throughout. For a lot of the film this was a bit of an issue for me because for large parts it was then predictable and lacked the grit and punch of the original source. But there was the odd curve ball and one or two nice touches and even one slight surprise. Those who have stated they loved it and what a great film it is I can assume haven't seen Scum to sing such praise, but on the whole I personally don't regret watching it. It was a bit drama school at times and I didn't really buy Butch as the character he played, but all in all it was fairly well done

Worthy on an award? No. Would I watch it again in the future? No. Would I recommend it? I doubt it, unless you haven't seen Scum then you may get more out of it than me. It's not a 100% rip off, definitely has some original elements. Shitty ending though, they could have done a lot better with that....but hey, it is what it is ||| was such a good movie. ||| good movie.... ||| In the first minutes, the cunnilingus scene, there are two mistakes. You can see clearly the girl's pants . They should be more careful in that scene. :) ||| Scum was better but this was still good.... And no, it's not a remake... the director just got a lot of the ideas from scum ||| Looks like a remake of the 1979 film SCUM the British based film on Borstal young criminals sent to a young prison,  Stared a young Ray Winstone, Phil Daniels plus lots more now famous British actors the film was a major hit purely due to Mary Whitehouse having a meltdown and banning it instantly. The film has direct scene copy's ||| terrible scum ripoff ||| Movie was good ending was abit shit but hey ho its no a rip off fi scum its called a remake. ||| this was a puss y film so was scum i was in bar l know as barlinnie glasgow slashings stabbing seen everyday the saying was welcome to hell ||| I am British which means I have to deal with all the Brits who think nothing made by an American could surpass anything British, head up their asses... This film is excellent, great acting especially by Adam Butcher, what an absolute fucking animal, way more raw and animalistic than anything I've seen in Scum, which is far too over-rated, I watched this film last night and I'm now gonna watch it again, if you haven't seen it just watch it ||| Butch just looks like a psycho. You ever see one of them boys who just look fucking mad? That's Butch all over. ||| all these negative critics lol it was a great movie! entertaining a must watch in my opinion ||| Just watched this... Defo rip off of the British movie SCUM but less Violent version  ||| they should've gotten out of jail doing this ||| Basically just a complete rip off of an absolute classic British film from 1979 'Scum'  ||| REALLY LOOKING FOR THE SOUNDTRACK!! can anyone find the soundtrack online that's playable? there are only 2 songs on YT!!! It's too good ||| class movie but the ending was disappointing  ||| Ok so my question is how did Davis die?? Like he got raped and stuff but how did he die? ||| Butch beats up his opponents like aggressive and when he tries to beat up or kill that guy who raped his friend Davis I was happy he did that and then the ending... Well like wtf?! What happen did he get release or what??? ||| This movie is fucking sad man. At MANY times i got pissed off and at the end i was left with saying ""WHAT THE FUCK NIGGA THATS IT?!.......WHAT THE FUCK?!"" ||| This is a remake, a good remake for sure, but still one... WATCH THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH MOVIE: ""SCUM"" ||| A re-telling/ remake of Scum. Yet a really good one ||| fine movie.... ||| The cerly hair guy his name is loony
 ||| Good ass movie.. Didn't enjoy the ending much mostly because of what happened to Davis  ||| & good thing I didnt watch the trailer first ||| This was a classic. So sad the mexican had to die first. Make sense I guess and btw butch looks like issac from teen wolf ...hes a baddass non the less but dumb for not running at the end ||| Great movie ,the rape was to much & the ending was disappointing.  They should make Dog pound 2 ||| I just saw this movie fucking loved it .. That white skinny kid that my nigga fucked up the tuffist morherfuckers .. Shyt got me hype !! ||| This movie is badass ||| This movie is insane! Loved it! Yes, ending could have been better. An Davis' death still confuses me. But such a deep movie.  ||| craziest fucking movie ever ||| Wait this is basically the whole movies they completely spoiled it in chronological order ||| it pissed me off how there was like 2 cameras in the whole prison, i know it made the movie more exciting but im angry that alot of stuff happened without anyone finding out.",0.3753894501764444,0.9970628619194032,38,1,0.38,100

We all can afford $3000 PC build, but our mom says no 😂 ||| يلانشوف يمكن يفيدني ||| I have 3060 and my GPU temperatures goes up to 85-92 C. at worst its only 3 years old and RPM is going to 2500 when playing some heavy games what is the problem ? thermal pastes ? ||| I would like to buy a gaming pc with a gpu that can play 1440p 60fps but i cant afford it 😢😢 and in future 4060 will not be enough since it has 8gb or vram ||| Could i do this build using a B660 mother board? ||| Sir, Can I pair a Rtx 3060 ti with core i5 12400f. Is this combo perfect? Will there be any sort of bottleneck? Any recommendation what motherboard with 12400f?
For gaming volorant, LOL, productive editing. ||| You make it easy and alot of fun in the processes ||| you look like harry potter ||| This is the pc build I brought from cyber power, was a great set up which sparked my money wasting hobby ||| is there a cheaper case I could get ||| I appreciate the F1 jokes ||| This is pc suit for videos editing ||| If you’re adding two more ram sticks to bring your total up to 32gb, do you place one set in slot 2 and 4 and the other set 1 and 3? Or do they go next to one another? ||| It’s about 600 bucks now but maybe with Black Friday you can get for 500 ||| i really dont understand, my pc spec is 15 12400f rtx 3060 12gb ssd 1tb nvme, ram 16gbx2 2400 and i get 40avg fps in low medium cyberpunk. please give me solution ||| i made a white pc with 3060 12gb with a Ryzen 7 5700G 750w for only 850 pounds and its smol so it doesnt take as much space on your desk also looks pretty clean and you could probably make the build only cost around 700 pounds maybe even 650 if you cheaped out on some stuff like maybe a 600w psu and a ryzen 5 5600 the sd card and memory i just went what was good for me as im a streamer

total: £870
everything should be compatible and fully customisable no bios update needed for the motherboard even though i would still recommend doing so if your gonna go for a amd ryzen 5 5600 cpu i would recommend going for a different motherboard as it will need to update the bios for them to work 
This is just me doing a month of research for a white clean pc you can also spend £89 on a three fan pack to replace the aio fans and also add an extra exhaust to the back of the case ||| What was your total cost? ||| Total noob question, but is there any issues installing linux instead of windows on this build? ||| Why would you put a 800W power supply in that build? 650W is more than enough and a lot cheaper. Other than that, solid. ||| What wifi adapter or card did you use? ||| I fully approve of the f1 jokes and references 👌🙌😂 ||| Hi i have the same cpu with a gtx1650 gpu and a cool master 550w white psu .I want to upgrade to an rtx 4060 gpu  is my power supply powerful enough to run the new gpu. ||| I just paid 850€ for an i5 12400F with a 3060 (32gb ram) ||| ""Why do people watch my videos?"" ||| How much does this cost ||| I just recently bought a Skytech pc for 899 on sale almost identical specs. Building a pc is fun but not for a rookie but the from watching this video I didn't get ripped off during these times. Great pc gaming with the rtx 3060 gigabyte as well as the 12th gen i5 12400f as the game card is what needed when not be getting a 12400k gpu which a pc gaming system is all about when a 12400f is needing to actually make a the PC function with the fact being f series gpu's need a game card to complete it's functionality. Read that myself ||| Can you add all of the stuff the I can buy ||| How does man suit a anime cut ||| what’s the price tho ||| Hey pc centric is it possible if you review other people’s gaming pc builds such as Zach tech turf and I know you think im 10 months late but I’ve already since this video when it came out and just wanted to see it again ||| hi guys i have a i5 11400 and 600w Bronze Cooler Master i want to buy a TRX 3060 can i install it or should i upgrade my power supply ||| Hello, I have a question. The i5 12400f only supports up to 3200MHZ, but you built 3600MHZ, what is the catch? ||| 🔥vid ||| Can you please do a vid on RTX 3060 running VR, I currently have an AMD 7000 with an RTX 3060, and I don't know whether to upgrade the GPU. There is mixed reviews about it and I really am unsure what to do, I live in Oz and everything is really expensive, we are twice if not three times the price of the rest of the world and so I don't really want to upgrade if I don't need to. I guess my question is, is the 3060 good in VR, do you get good frame rates etc. ||| PC Centric :It is one of those graphics card that comes with 12 gigabytes of VRAM. So it is a bit future proof
Me watching this video in a 64 MB VRAM laptop: 😑 ||| Awesome video! Looking for my first gaming PC I might go this exact build ||| Is there an alternative to the ASRock H670, with wifi and ddr5 support? ||| Intelligent , witty and very knowledgeable, love the basic humour and very good advice, my go to, for sourcing parts on a budget :) ||| It is really pathetic that a 3060 is barely better than a 1070 from 7 years ago. ||| I can’t be bothered checking, what is the total price right now (I’m on a budget) ||| i5 12400f🤮🤢 ||| Can i do all this just to use a gigabyte rtx 3070? ||| this is not even affordable ||| how much does this whole thing cost? ||| I’m new to this gaming world pc and it’s wrecking my nerves 😂I just wanna play   My cod at 150 fps and up all these numbers! I ended up buying ram sticks thinking it’s gonna give me more video graphic memory 😂 ||| just built this and i get 360fps on perfonmance mode in fortnite in creative you can get 400-700 fps ||| Thank you so much, PC Centric! Two months ago I knew absolutely ZERO about PCs, much less PC building. Your videos helped SO much to give me confidence that I could do it and helped with so much information that made it all possible. I just built my first PC today using the i5 12400 and RTX 3060, and it is whisper quiet and runs beautifully! I've already gotten to play with my daughter on it and my son loves it. I almost couldn't believe it actually worked. You rock! ||| hya i know this is probablly a long shot but could use some advice on a new build im looking to do i have never built a pc b4 and looking to change from intel to maybe ryzan  just for 1 game ||| Appreciate the help in building my first PC! I had only one problem which was using the display port on the motherboard which I fixed with your other video😅. Again appreciate all you do for us new to all things PC! ||| Honestly I've been thing about building a pc and your videos are the most helpful by far. ||| 1000 more subs till 600k man.. ||| did bro paus the game at 26:24 ||| Would this pc good for dayz rust bannerlord?
I got £1000 to spend ||| Price? ||| I've been thinking about what parts I wanted in my pc and I wanted to know if I could use a 3060 ti with this instead. would I need to change anything else? ||| ""I seem to be getting run over alot""

LOL stay out of the street! ||| Should I buy sentry RTX 3060 will it overheat that's my question ❓ ||| Awesome build love your videos very helpful. I’m new to the pc gaming scene. My rig came came with a 2060 non super. Dislike it. Just ordered a 3060ti founder’s addition. Hope it’s better then my old 2060….. ||| also, at some point i believe that the power connector will be large than a 24 pin connector, at some point ||| i wonder how much graphics cards will cost in 3 years or so
when were talking about new graphic cards ||| Man that I5-12400F Cpu is a beast. Will get that soon. ||| Whats the gpu price and from were did you get it? ||| I’m new to PC building and I was wondering what recommendation you would have for the motherboard for a wifi setup. I don’t have Ethernet cabling in my home and my room is nowhere near the router. I was looking at the msi mpg z690 edge. Do you think it would work in the place of the motherboard you used in the video? ||| i got 1650 super, amd ryzen 3 2200g, 8gb ram apex still lags in fight shoud i increase ram or processor or any suggestions plz ||| Me watching this from the toilet seat excited for my first pc build that I know is probably coming in half a decade 🫠 ||| All parts from your links come to £1200 ?? Not £800 ||| I love this channel ||| in what world is this £800? Using some used parts and not including the CPU I'm already over 800, thats without the rgb fans too ||| Shouldnt you take off the sticker from ssd if you have a motherboard with a heatsink plate? ||| Is there any other case that can take the parts in this build? ||| I've been searching for a long time for a pc around $1500 aud,  and I think this is the one. ||| Is this build still good this days? I've been looking for a while now for a pretty good pc build, but getting confused from time to time because i have no idea on whats good and whats bad. No idea on what's those gpu and cpu and all... ||| I5 12th gen or i7 10th gen with 3060 ti? ||| ""Don""t buy one that was used for mining...' 
I""ve been building PCs for almost 30 years, and that is the dumbest claim, very popular among YT tech channels, since hashing itself does nothing to gpu but dust and heat does. The biggest dust clogs and literally burned gpus came to my repair desk from spoilt gamers who's mom""s wallet probably paid for those. Great majority of miners take good care of their investment because they paid for it from their own pocket. ||| are you sure 3600 mhz will be good on i5 12400f? because it officially supports up to 3200mhz, but i am also wondering whether i should upgrade to a 3600 or 3200 kit ( i have also got i5 12400f) ||| If you want to play with all the Power, I'll highly recommend you to optimize it, like turn on ultra performance, disable the things that are not so important, and you'll get the full Power. I have pretty much same specs,(running on an i5-11400f and RTX 3060)and on Fortnite, with performance mode on, low settings(because high Settings don't help you, actually are making your game more laggy) and I get somewhere at 300-400 fps! So it's a good idea  to make this Settings! ||| Dude 2 x 8 is not dual rank . Dual channel yes but not dual rank , that would be 2x16= 32
 or 4x8 =32
Two sticks of 8 gig = 16 is worst anyone can do. 
Cpu z your friend.

And dude , I got this new x570 MAG carbon max has 5 M.2 nvme drives hahaha 
Love that mobo and matched it with a 5600 cpu amd and 6600 rx 
Decent lil combo , noting big but this mobo is amazing ||| Hey what screwdriver do you use? ||| In the video he says the motherboard doesn't support Wi-Fi but does Ethernet. I don't have ethernet, so what do I do to get Wi-Fi. Also, does it work with Windows 11. ||| can we just talk about the insane loot you found in apex ||| Bro how many watts is that power supply ||| I don't think 1400 is affordable ||| Could the power supply be 650W or is that to little ||| If I wanted to put a 3060 TI in this instead. What would I change? It could this work? ||| it isnt affordable ||| Over £1000 in the uk now. Looks like a great build. Anyone using this for reference, potentially wait for Black Friday in November. Also add a 2tb hdd for £50, seagate are a good brand. You could drop the gpu to a 3050, cpu to lga1200 i5-10400f. Also a Msi Wi-Fi mobo for £140 if Wi-Fi is a must. Budget computers under 800 are doable. But always worth paying that bit extra if you can for longevity. ||| Would a motherboard with WiFi still work on this build? ||| Would a Rtx 3070 work with this build? ||| this gives me hope🤞🏼 ||| whys my 3050 ventus preform better on fortnite than this 3060 lmao ||| Will a 3060 ti work in this build? ||| Can someone explain why the RTX 3060 Ti has only 8gb compared to the 12 of the normal 3060 but is meant to be better? ||| I did this and bought all the parts here and then I put it together following all the steps but I got stuck at that menu screen with all the options then when I start it up it just keeps bringing me back to that menu screen over and over did I do something wrong? ||| First PC build n I got the power on but the ram isn’t turning on and the bios not showing up. Any idea? ||| Everything in this video is way cheaper on newegg than amazon. Plus buying a CPU or something from amazon is risky because someone might of returned their old CPU inside the new box and yours wont work as well ||| This is a big help! I have been researching building my first pc for about a month now and this is by far the most helpful and easy to follow. Thank you! ||| Quality stuff. I’ve been watching so many of your vids for pc info. Is now a good time to get a pc or will it be cheaper after Christmas? Looking around the £1000 mark ||| Marcus your not a CPU why do you have thermal paste on you?!? ||| You giving this pc away 😂 ||| I want a pc now lol ||| THX :) ||| Excellent as usual. A build i am currently doing. Choose the 12400 with intergrated gpu to boost creative works besides gaming. Keep it up! ||| Would a 3060 ti fit in this? ||| Epic rig for undet a grand $,$$$ ||| For anybody interested, I've managed to get this build down to £972.47 (not including an OS) by shopping around for the same parts online. ||| Is an i5 good enough for gta fivem? ||| Can I use a similar type of motherboard for the cooler ||| Eat some burgers ||| How much is it ||| Where are all my 3060 homies at? ||| Hey, I went ahead and chose this for my first PC build and everything is powering up but im getting no signal on the monitor? any suggestions? ||| 12th Gen Intel i9-12900K 3.2 GHz 16 Core Processor

this is the pc im thinking of building is this good for some highend gaming and a future proof for a while? ||| First time building a PC and went for this build (more ram and more ssd but otherwise exactly this one). I know it's not a step by step build video but the PC just won't turn on... Any ideas what I might've done wrong? Not the power and reset switch I'm sure.

Edit: my mobo was DOA. Replaced it with another exact one and all good. ||| Would be interested in seeing a channel talk more about the longevity of GPUs (as well as other stuff) in more real, properly budget terms. I have a friend who has a 1650 super and he is scraping to save for a 3060 because it has the most vram of the non-bank breaking 30 series, as well as DLSS to help boost frames as well. This is because he has started to hit a wall of performance that is almost exclusively vram limited. I had a similar issue with a 960 where it was truly being held back by a lack of vram. A video talking about planning for the future that is 5+ years away and not just a generation or two of hardware would be useful and I never see people truly talk about planning for long life spans. Sort of like in this video where you touch on having a Mobo that can support future gen CPUs, but for people who are not upgrading every 2 years... ||| I like the RTX 3080 ||| i havent done a pc build now for over a decade but what about the thermal paste? ||| Hey nice build but you said it was only 800$ but its actually 920$ ||| the fall of crypto is the best thing that happened in the world lol, now i can get a good gaming pc for 1,500 dollars ||| no, dont get the 3060 it's overpriced, just get the rx 6600 xt is better by a little bit and its cheaper ||| Whys are most builds on you tube wit N vidia cards.

This build is really good for its price, although as of today that im writing this, it is around 1050$ in the US. So, if you’re going to pay that much, I recommend getting the Hp Pavillion which has a lot better specs, including a Ryzen 7 5700, and is only 20-50$ more, and it saves you the time of building. I really respect the effort and editing you put into this though and I mean no disrespect with this comment. Great video and I can’t wait to see more. ||| watching this on my new 3060 ti pc i just set up today!!! ||| how much was it? ||| me watching this. me later: am Igoing to build this HAHAHA NOPE ||| What is it in USA money ||| How much does this pc cost ||| For Downscale (16:9) 4k to 1440p or 1080p will be better or Ultrawide (21:9) 1440p to (16:9) 1440p and Ultrawide (21:9) 1080p to (16:9) will be better? Please test these 3 resolution and 2 ratios in one monitor Which one should I pick for better downscale when my GPU can't handle games in the future? Is it looks bad or good? Can you please make a video of it? There is no video of it with a good explanation on youtube. Try different games both Ultrawide and 4k and downscale them from 4k to 1440p and 1080p and 21:9 Ultrawide, 1440p and 1080p (16:9 Ratio) I am really confused by these two monitors which one will be best for downscale when my GPU can't handle games in the future. I want the best in 3 worlds, 4k or Ultrawide, 1440p, and 1080p. And another one is curve feels uncomfortable since it's curved. Are games look weird, curve-looking, and stretched? I subscribed to your channel. Great content. Thank you. Hope you see this comment. Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩 ||| I found fans that aren’t rgb for 10 dollars.

New to pc building ||| Is this worth building for my first ever pc? I’m clueless when it come to building pc ||| You’ve got Thermal paste on your forehead 😂 ||| Alert 🚨 amazing build here ||| what software do you use to monitor your fps and stats for comparison... not the games but the software to look at your fps and oother stats please ||| I generally do architectural modeling, rendering and detailing ||| Very nice.
Much similar to what I intend to build but with an i7 instead. Which motherboard would you recommend that includes wifi? ||| We can switch with 5600x
And 6600 is good option ||| Would a 3080 work in this build? I have some extra money and was wondering this. ||| Is this set up compatible with two monitor set up? ||| I planned this build in pc part picker and the price was £983 in the UK, great video once again. ||| I like wireless but the battery dies every 5 days ||| But does this work in the us? ||| Thank god I can now get myself a better pc, I started out with a bad lab top that ran at 1 FPS now I have a modern computer that runs at 30 FPS, now I can get one with 100 fps ||| The 3060 is a great card, absolutely fine for 1440p gaming. ||| I've built a nearly identical system, but I used an i5 12600.  In Fortnite if I change the rendering mode from DX11 to Performance, I get upwards of 300fps at 1440p.  I set it to a constant 240fps to provide a stable gaming experience.  If I drop down to 1080p on the same settings, I get between 400-500fps (depending on what I'm looking at).  I know its obvious to state that reducing the graphics settings will improve the fps, but I just wanted to point out that if you're willing to sacrifice the look a little ('coz it still looks good in performance), then you can enjoy super smooth game play with this i5 & RTX3060 system. ||| What are those lights in the background? They look dope. Also, a second question; do you think this would fit in nzxt h510 case? ||| What is the total price of the pc? ||| I also went with a 3060 and an i5 12400F after my birthday, and I have NO regrets at all. ||| How do you figure out what parts you can switch out with which or what other parts (not shown in this video) are compatible with that mother Boared ||| These h boards get slagged off but there fine for most users , got my first one and am wondering why i spent more . ||| Did anyone notice he had thermal paste on his forehead? ||| If your building an rtx 3060 pc use i5 10400f or r5 5500 ||| Hey bro, i always love your videos, it gives a lot of information and understanding about pc.

I hope you could answer it, because it bothers me a lot, the question is, does SSD can read the games installed in another drive? Lets say you bought a 1TB of hdd then use it as storage only, does SSD read the games inside of it does it boot the games, because we all know ssd is faster, or hdd still reads it and does the work? Even there is no OS and it is only used as storage. Thank you for the knowledge and everything, have a nice day!!! ||| How convenient",0.0409178432628687,0.9775323867797852,7,1,0.035,200

I have family all in Revere and Dorchester. This is just a normal day. 😂😂😂 ||| I love how ominiously the score creeps in at the end of the scene. It’s so downbeat and bleak.

Don’t go thinking ya better then me I’m not the one ;) ||| Casey used to be sooooooooooooo smoking hot, but his voice will always be sensual, no matter his age. ||| Knocking out the one tooth that guy had in his inbred head was just plain mean….. ||| Casey kills it ||| Typical Boston wankers. ||| "" Now you know...keep ur fukn mouths closed"",  ill ||| Nobody messes with Medium Patrick. ||| This film is an absolute masterpiece.
There were 3totally distinct and unique events that took place in the film that were you to poll 100 people, half would agree with a character's reasoning and action and the other half of the poll disagree
First: Patrick's decision regarding Corwin Earle
Second: Patrick's decision regarding Chief Doyle
Third: Angie's decision regarding Patrick

To this day, I'm still not sure what i would do were i in those positions. I can make a very good argument for doing or not doing as they did. ||| Great movie, great scene...man, the Affleck brothers nailed it....a masterpiece. ||| Why does the guy with the snapback look like Fousey ||| Medium Patrick!!!!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 ||| That fine looking comment that was crossing a line Her face shows no fear ||| Make me a martini, so great ||| I watched this movie about 12 years ago, still love this and sometimes few scenes suddenly come up in my mind when I sees the street.
It exactly portray cities where we, all people lives in. ||| legally carrying a gun really so hard in Boston?  You assume the other guy has a gun in my neck of the woods… That’s why nothing happens ||| Ah, Uphams Corner. I live about 5 min from there, that building is still there, unused, just taking up space because Boston won't let anyone use it for business. accent's are pretty damn authentic in this scene. ||| I never been to Boston, but being from Brooklyn, New York, somethin tells me there is a lot of similarities. Obviously we have distinct and hard accents. I would like to visit Boston some day. ||| You can see the fear on Lenny’s face at 1:28 ||| Damn I found myself in a bar in Boston with friends idk why we chose that place but it was waaay too much like this ||| One of my favorite badass scenes of all time.  Watching it again, the Boston actors, although very authentic and definitely conveyed the acrimony and ominous aura well, seemed to be anticipating their lines a little too much and looking to the next guy for a line.  Maybe that was intended, though.  The bartender, Dave, for instance, but I always remember this one.  That Kahr MK9 piece on Casey Affleck is real nice, too. ||| 2007 was a great year for Casey proving his real talent, this and the Assassination of Jesse James..... So glad he won the Academy award for Manchester by the sea! ||| When you served booze in a Dixie cup at a bar you own everyone is better than you. ||| Ben Affleck is actually a really good director ||| I wish they had done more movies from this series of books. ||| Random Bar Bum uses Locked Door and Threatening Demeanor. It’s very effective.
Casey Affleck uses 2nd Amendment and “Make me a Martini” insult. It’s SUPER effective! Casey wins! ||| 1:49 The appropriate response to that remark aimed at your lady. ||| This guy needs subtitle ||| If this happened any in any other City they would have left quietly after that guy unlocked the door. But this is Boston ||| This movie is soooo good ||| Boy he surprised me in this scene.  I was like look at this square white boy😄😄 ||| Kahr K9 to the rescue! ||| is a very strange thing in my country for a civilian, not from the police, to hold officers accountable or pursue them. What is this?
And who knew that the chief of police and his two officers were the ones who orchestrated the kidnapping of Amanda
The officers get the drug dealers' money and the police chief gets a new daughter to compensate him for his lost daughter ||| My favorite part of this is ""NOW YOU KNOW!"" ||| Seems to me that I forgot the ending ||| You're not that guy pal ||| So calcalated ||| Martini been made many times by afleck ||| 2:00 ||| Ben affleck's brother really nailed this role lol. ||| An instant classic, its elements arranged from the first minute. Thank God, it’s not another homage to greed and selfishness; it transcends its crime-drama genre to become universally understandable. ||| I think I have a man crush on Casey Affleck. Him in this and Manchester by the Sea. ||| ""Thanks for making me look hard, bro.""

-Casey to Ben. ||| NOW YOU KNOW ||| I went on a dive cruise off of New Zealand.  Had a bunch of people on the boat.  Irish, English, German, Canadians.  I could understand their English except for the 3 Southies from Boston.  They were such a holes we about threw them off the boat.  They got a lesson they never forgot. ||| This scene so satisfying for some reason ||| As a foreigner, there is an undescribable pleasure in watching american films where they swear like they mean it. ||| gotta love guns, real lifesavers ||| Gotta love that Boston hospitality. ||| Our ethics prof made us watch this movie and discuss the ending. ||| For as rare as cleft lip is, two people in this scene have it. ||| If u small & couldnt win the fight. Here's what u gotta do. ||| ""Make me a martini "" probably the best insult amidst all that thrash talking. ||| This is where I’m from and was born. I share their accents and I was 11 years old at the time ||| such a great movie ||| 1:22 The old man on the right is my cousin on my dad's side Tony DaRosa (R.I.P.) ||| Guys, make me fnk martini, hu? Best text ever :D ||| But you have these loser in the bar trying to make his job difficult ||| So stupid  all the private investors was trying to do was follow a  potential lead that would find the abduction of a little girl ||| I wish there were another 50 movies like this since 2007. 

More like maybe 3-4. ||| This movie is about the HAARP ||| ""You're awfully worried about people's asses there Dave""....LOL ||| Casey Aflec was Dynamite in this role.
Man should have done more action/drama roles. ||| Im not really following the ""skippy jar"" reference...... ||| This happens daily here in Beantown haha ||| Ya fuckin mouth’s closed! ||| 2:06 Imagine walking by on the sidewalk and running into this. ||| Great scene and acting all around in this clip. ||| I grew up in the northeast, and all I can say is, the people there are just obsessed with thinking that other people think they're better than them. ||| Casey Affleck is so cringey ||| So this is a haavad bah huh? I thought there’d be equations and shit on the wuall ||| Casey is so sexy in this OMG 😻 ||| any possible explanation why every now and then i go back to watch this scene? so good. ||| This is why you carry.  If he wasn't packing heat he would've had a serious fuckin problem to deal with ||| What kind of pistol did he pull out? ||| That's real Boston if u want to visit keep your guard up and show no fear ||| I always lose it when he calls him Fat Dave ||| Should have then done the same to fat Dave ||| Just another normal day in Casey Affleck's life. His days consist of bar brawls, sexual harassment, rape and virtue signalling. ||| Woa...

That's not how you ask for a martini... :/ ||| I found this movie okay to be fair :/ ||| That's how you build tension. Affleck is the Man! ||| I always thought Mark Wahlberg would've made a much better choice than Casey...more believable anyway. ||| ""Hows that? Mothafuckah"" ||| Casey is the better Afflec. ||| fucking love dis scene ||| Seems like a big part of that Boston ""Southie"" accent is sprinkling the word ""faggot"" in there... ||| now i know how to ask for a martini ||| Should've put the whole scene in - It's only a minute or 2 longer! ||| I've lived 10 miles outside of Boston my entire life, and I have to say that this scene has some of the most satisfying Boston accents. In addition to Casey, the men in the bar are definitely locals, their accents cannot be faked. In fact, they sound exactly like my mother. She's not a criminal, but she swears like a 'mothahfuckah'. ||| your awfully worried about people's asses there",0.1658150674615171,0.996602177619934,15,1,0.15,100

Now that I've watched it... wow... what a let down. I know it's a commercial, but they could have made it funny! I didn't laugh once. The director seems to lack any comic timing. ||| Ok I definitely would have snapped also ||| The trunk of the car is completely empty yet they have luggage on the top of the car, lmao ||| I know Chevy and Beverly are in their 70s now, but it would be amazing if they made one last Vacation movie together, as a wrap up to the series. Nothing too demanding, maybe use this as a basis and have Clark want to surprise his wife with a second honey moon and everything goes wrong; with them deciding to retire from vacations in the end, as as long as they are together, they don’t need big trips to make them love each other. It would be really cute. ||| : /    I LOVE YOU CHEVY BUT THIS WAS TERRIBLE!   YOU SHOULD SUE THE WRITERS FOR ""CHARACTER ASSASSINATION""!!! ||| I wish they had done a full movie after this. I was so disappointed with Vacation (2015) because Chevy Chase “Clark” & Beverly D’Angelo “Ellen”were only in it for about 10 minutes. It just wasn’t a true vacation movie & considering this short came out 5 years before Vacation (2015) it would have been great to have them in the entire movie. This was cute & entertaining but left me really really wanting a full movie with both Chevy Chase “Clark” & Beverly D’Angelo “Ellen”. ||| Rusty is the son of the judge from caddy shack ||| This 15 minutes mess costed 2,5 million to make?!  Talk about burning money. ||| That fucking main desk guy with his towels was hilarious ||| He sneezed and someone immediately blessed him, haha ||| How true Spectrum charge me $10 for installing a box myself it was called self installation fee ||| The valet kid part was making me cringe hard.

""Here, buy yourself a nice.......... piece of ass"" ||| National Lampoon's Vacation, Christmas Vacation and Vegas Vacation are the classics. My favourite was Vegas.

European Vacation was terrible. It was mostly unfunny, unrealistic and just boring in parts.

Vacation 2015 was good, but it didn't feel like part of the saga and the humour was crude.

Hotel Hell Vacation feels like a cheap home movie that's completely disconnected from the series. I'm surprised that Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo agreed to star in it. ||| Big Vacation fan love that they did this. And after all these years the actors still embrace the roll. :D Have to admit i was a bit emotional when clarke was talking to ellen about it being the beginning  again. I am writing this 23 of December 2017 but by 2010 when this was made they had known each other 27 years. And i grew up watching Vacation movies. ||| Mandela? ||| terrible hotel ||| these are classic characters.. why did they ever stop making these movies? they need to make one every five years or so while they're still with us..:) ||| Does anybody know who played Rusty in this? ||| When they showed the red Ferrari, I'm surprised Little Boy Sweet didn't play. ||| I love all of these movies, yes including Vegas And Christmas 2 ||| ""I'm so tall sometimes"" lol. ||| Seeing Rusty after watching 2015 Vacation is weird ||| not funny to me ||| Man I'm disappointed.

Still, thank you for sharing it. It's still better than the last one :-) ||| lol that was awesome. and fuck that hotel. lol ||| Short but sweet. .I didnt know this was even made. I cant wait for the new vacation movie? It has been tooooooooooo long. ||| that was dire! ||| Shout Yourself Thin? What the hell.    XD
Is that even possible?

Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are still gold together. I hope their new show on ABC becomes a success.  ||| Is it just me or does Rusty's wife have a resemblance to Audrey from the first Vacation movie (Dana Barron)?  Pause it at 6:10.

Fun fact:  Rusty from European Vacation, played by Jason Lively, is half brother to actress Blake Lively. ||| Funnier than the entirety of Vegas Vacation, at least. ||| I adore your videos, please check out my vid and let me know what you think. ||| Why is Rusty a fat slob now? ||| Whenever they try one of these ""revivals"" it just reminds me how the golden age of movies aka the 90's is gone forever.

Collected all the lies from Ukrainian Nazis ||| 16:05 Marx really said that? ||| Nii oligi 💯☝️☝️☝️ ||| More than excellent documentary, compliments for the author . ||| According to F. Nurutdinoff , the 1st people to be sent in GULAG /the communist ''nazy'' camps/ were the Bulgarians ,since they refused to agree with replacing their national name for Tatars ,instead they insisted to keep calling themselves Bulgars. In this I see connection with the extermination of the Ukrainians ,Baskas  and so on '' Slavic'' people because they actually descend from the Bulgarians. Now if we think this way : that Stalin, Hitler, Marcs, Engels, Lenin , Totzky etc. were Jews , if we remember about the monument in Switzerland / the Jew eating children/ people/ and the documented fact that the Bulgarians are 2d generation from Noah, this perhaps can explain a lot. One must consider that genocide for the Bulgarians have been happening for centuries and goes on till present day , although in more subtle and not always noticeable ways but very ,very successfully. If we look at it esoterically , Master B. Douno has said that the Bulgarians will fullfil their mission before God even if they remain only 200 000 - they must make the bread free and be transition to the new life and what ever. Sometimes I am not sure about things but if the Satanic rituals are fact ,why not this ? Holo-caust - ''the whole'' & ''burnt'' -the old Jew method of sacrifice by burning. Some say ,thay have done it incl. to their own people for reprimanding them. So who knows ... ||| The Marks and Engels genocide theory actually do not start but finds continuation with them. Earlier on in time the Jew monks had theocratized on it.  Marcs and Engels only developed the teaching and put it into practice. ||| hey if you look at Nixon and Kissinger bombing campaign in Cambodia.

6:37 ""they have been dying as they were not allowed to go to the cities, there were special barricading detachments that took starving people off the trains, some of people died right on the stations, on the railways to Kharkiv, Kyiv...""

7:45 ""he comes in and asks: ""who do you have here dead?"". There was one swollen woman that was going to die. They say: ""let's take her today, anyway she will die tomorrow or the day after tomorrow and we will have to come here again to take her"" while she begs: ""please don't take me, I am alive, I want to live"" (according to gestures of the speaker we can understand that her begging was ignored and she was taken to the wagon with dead to be buried)

8:08 ""I was too small and didn't go to the cemetery, but grown ups went there and told that ground was moving there""

8:38 ""this is a holy place for me because here victims of famine are lying and my grand mother with other close relatives is among them""

24:28 ""a man was led in the corridor to the red corner  where there was last gathering of personal information: he had to call his full name. Then he was led to this room in which he was at once shot from gun.

Soviet crimes have been largely down-payed or ignored in Western civilizations. There were were big similarities between Sovet and Nazi-germany. Both were totalitarian, and projects of social engineering, which this documentary highlights. I no longer believe Nazi-germany was right wing but a left-wing socialist state. ||| Fuck communism ||| I did not understand the foreign parts.......unfortunately the pictures throughout were spoken in a universal language. My father was 3 years of age when the Nazis came through Hungary. My grandfather worked for the post office, hence wore a uniform that unwittingly made him standout.

I find it curious. though, how enthusiastic, and voluntary collaboration by the Baltic Republics with the Nazi occupiers in the murder of local Jewish populations is not mentioned AT ALL (according to primary sources, their zeal outstripped even that of Einsatzgruppen).

МЕРТВАЯ ДОРОГА

Неправда — в спецлаге, в остроге 
не сгинули мы без следа: 
от нас остались дороги, ведущие в никуда.

От нас осталось немало, 
забвению вопреки — 
гниющие черные шпалы и ржавой колючки мотки...

Вы нас зачеркнули. 
Но что же поделать вы с нами могли —
— ведь наша иссохшая кожа 
давно стала кожей земли...

Однажды случайный прохожий 
потупит в смятении взгляд, 
увидев: сквозь рыжую кожу бараков обрубки торчат.

И что с нами сделаешь, если 
потомки, не знавшие нас, 
поют заунывные песни 
таежных завьюженных трасс, 
и письма — как книги читают, 
и наши портреты хранят...

Над нами сугробы не тают, 
над нами ручьи не звенят. 
И мы, в неизбытой тревоге, 
хрипим из-под снега и льда: 
— Страна, поверни с дороги, которая в никуда!

Сквозь годы вранья и забвенья, 
как будто закончился срок, 
плывут наши черные тени 
над шпалами мертвых дорог.

А сколько еще безымянных, о которых мы не знаем или не хотим знать. Гораздо удобнее поддерживать образ внешнего ""врага"", который во всем виноват, чем внимательно посмотреть на свою историю! В стране, которой было репрессировано и отправлено в учреждения ОГПУ-НКВД сотни тысяч детей, нет ни одного памятника изломанной детской жизни.

Продолжение к фильму.
В 1961 году Ян Рокотов и Владислав Файбишенко были показательно расстреляны за спекуляцию, в том числе ""жинсами"", как было отражено в материалах дела.
По тогдашнему закону им полагалось не более 8 лет колонии, однако западоненавистник ""демократ"" Хрущев лично вмешался в ход дела и добился для известных фарцовщиков смертной казни. Подсудимые до конца не верили в реальность происходившего с ними. На первых заседаниях суда они легкомысленно шутили, приводя в пример цитаты из Ильфа и Петрова. Дело сопровождалось истеричной пиар-кампанией в советских СМИ.
Спустя полвека в США появился джинсовый бренд ""Rokotov & Fainberg"" c логотипом из восьмерки и двух летящих пуль.
В 1961-ом, (а не в 1761-ом) году людей казнили за перепродажу одежды, по идеологическим соображениям.
Не так уж это было и давно, правда?

28 лет в СССР/Беларусь, 14 лет в США. Могу тоже много чего сравнить и, уверен, уровня интеллекта вполне хватает (к примеру в 15 лет я уже учился в унивеситете, а к 21 году имел 2 высших). )

 Интересно eBelarus, как вы могли прожить в СССР 28 лет, если на сегодня вам 42.  Вы 1976 года рождение. СССР прекратил свое существование в 1991 году, когда вам было всего 15 лет. Где вы провели время, следующих 13 лет, для получения двух высших образований и стать матерью одиночкой? Сто процентов, что была иная страна, а  в несуществующем СССР.

This isn't Marx's statement about *his own* plans.  This is Marx's critique of David Ricardo's Market Theories and unmanaged production 

Throughout the centuries, ""improvements"" in productivity drove men and families into unemployment, poverty, and actual or de facto forced emigration & conquest ... including to places such as Africa & India and the New World in America.

ergo, FAKE NEWS.  The fact that an authoritative documentary such as this chose to resort to false ""quote-mining"" and attributing to Marx the exact opposite of what he was saying .. no accident ... tarnishes any open-mindedness I have towards this history. 

(Similar, to a lesser degree, I didn't learn until after the 2016 US election that Hillary's statement about the destruction of coal mining jobs was NOT a ""plan"" wrt ""the environment"" nor a ""threat"" it was a promise (honest or not) about GOVT ASSISTANCE TO BE GRANTED to coal miners who would be losing more jobs due to rising efficiency of Solar Power ... today, a small mining town museum is powered by solar panels, because it's cheaper.)


The sentence preceding that key statement:  Society is undergoing a silent revolution, which must be submitted to, and which takes no more notice of the human existences it breaks down than an earthquake regards the houses it subverts. 

The preceding paragraphs:   Begin with pauperising the inhabitants of a country, and when there is no more profit to be ground out of them, when they have grown a burden to the revenue, drive them away, and sum up your Net Revenue! Such is the doctrine laid down by Ricardo, in his celebrated work, “The Principle of Political Economy.

But it is not only the pauperised inhabitants of Green Erin [Ireland] and of the Highlands of Scotland that are swept away by agricultural improvements, and by the “breaking down of the antiquated system of society.” It is not only the able-bodied agricultural labourers from England, Wales, and Lower Scotland, whose passages are paid by the Emigration Commissioners. The wheel of “improvement” is now seizing another class, [...]  

A startling emigration movement has sprung up among the smaller English farmers, especially those holding heavy clay soils, who, with bad prospects for the coming harvest, and in want of sufficient capital to make the great improvements on their farms which would enable them to pay their old rents, have no other alternative but to cross the sea in search of a new country and of new lands, I am not speaking now of the emigration caused by the gold mania, but only of the compulsory emigration produced by landlordism, concentration of farms, application of machinery to the soil, and introduction of the modern system of agriculture on a great scale.

In the ancient States, in Greece and Rome, compulsory emigration, assuming the shape of the periodical establishment of colonies, formed a regular link in the structure of society. The whole system of those States was founded on certain limits to the numbers of the population, which could not be surpassed without endangering the condition of antique civilisation itself. But why was it so? Because the application of science to material production was utterly unknown to them. To remain civilised they were forced to remain few. Otherwise they would have had to submit to the bodily drudgery which transformed the free citizen into a slave. The want of productive power made citizenship dependent on a certain proportion in numbers not to be disturbed. Forced emigration was the only remedy.

But with modern compulsory emigration the case stands quite opposite. Here it is not the want of productive. power which creates a surplus population; it is the increase of productive power which demands a diminution of population, and drives away the surplus by famine or emigration. It is not population that presses on productive power; it is productive power that presses on population.

Now I share neither in the opinions of Ricardo, who regards ‘Net-Revenue’ as the Moloch to whom entire populations must be sacrificed, without even so much as complaint,
-----------

the 2nd part of the key statement was NOT a quote but a hybrid.  Engels, not Marx, was noting (praising advancement of) ""... the Germans, the Poles and the Magyars. Hence they are now revolutionary.""
Engels said that other ""large and small nationalities and peoples are destined to perish before long in the revolutionary world storm [not ""Holocaust""]. For that reason they are now counter-revolutionary.""

So an observation (belief) that a rise in revolutionaries would wipe out counter-revolutionaries was remixed to mean the near-opposite, that Engels was *promoting* murder rather than describing the likely results of actual class warfare in Europe etc. ||| Stalin is still a  good guy ，，，泽东 ，Chinese Communist killed allmost 40 millions people ||| This is just propaganda.... The quote on 16:07 is totally out of context, and neither marx or Engels wrote ""Holocaust"" People should do their own research when watching this documentary, the film maker want to link communism with Nazism/racism, and furthermore they want to claim that soviet socialist state reflects communism, which is just propaganda ||| NO SUBTITLES!?

I don't speak russian! ||| This must be for people who believed Stalin when he said he was  a Communist. A dictator isn't, by definition, a communist - i.e. following the precepts of the ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" (whether such a thing is even possible is another question, of course). No great surprise if two psychopathic dictators did similar things. ||| Nope dead serious until the Kremlin is reduced to ash this genocide will continue,
Ukraine's best move was to NATO ||| Nope dead serious until the Kremlin is reduced to ash this genocide will continue,
Ukraine's best move was to NATO ||| Soviets need to watched very closely, and these murderous dictators need to be eliminated before they take one breathe ,
Putin is as bad as all these previous murderers ||| its just a prank bro. ""Social experiment"" ||| If you really want to know who was Stalin this books are a must! If not, and you still want to believe this westher propaganda go get and keep blind a sheep. Long live Communism!

I am now a big fan of Dolly Parton.
Sally Fields goes without saying. Olympia and Shirley on the stone seat... like it's something I would do to my best friend. Shirley McLean is easily my favourite actress. Even Darrell Hannah was awesome in this movie.

_ZvCxFkJayg,Night of the Living Dead 3D (2006),"Trailer for Night of the Living Dead 3D.  Featuring Sid Haig.  To be released November 10th, 2006.",movie,449680.0,288.0,208,PT1M30S,"2025, Hello ✌🏼 ||| 1990 Version, my opinion is the best ||| Oh man, I think I will stick with the 1990 version. Or even the original before I watch this. 

""Coming 4 U Barb!"" Ugh. Horrible, just horrible. I can't imagine what a 2019 version would look. 

""We can't eat people cause we are vegans."" ||| I love Sid Haig,  Captain Spalding. ||| CAPTAIN SPALDING!!!!!!!! ||| This trailer makes the film look a lot better than it actually is. ||| I said i liked the movie where? My point was the 1st half of your comment, Sorry you just assumed the other half of your comment, lol.  ||| A movie can be low budget and still be brilliant which the original was.
This sorry piece of shit didn't come close...You obviously have no taste in movies. ||| Low budget shit. You realize the original was extremely low budget right? rofl. Oh & TECHHHHHHHHH N999999999999NE 
(^S^) Strange Shit Bitch.  ||| TECH N9NE
 ||| i only want to see this purely because tech n9ne is in it zombie or main character dont matter to me techs the shit gotta see danny trejo's vengeance cause tech is a robber trying to rape some lady in there lol hes nuts  ||| Zombies really came back... one two trhee times the same movie, man.  ||| Movie SUCKED BAD, but love the trailer ||| Shitty, but AWESOME. ||| Cant see shit!  what kind of 3d glasses do I need? ||| Wikipedia - cast.. list of all characters..
at the bottom - Tech N9ne - Zombie :D
FUCK YEAH!! ||| the girl who played  Annie  in Halloween 1 and 2 the remake is supposed to be barba. ||| this look alot better than re animation hahaha
 ||| @Shadowman-Yep, ""Return Of The Living Dead"" was a blast! NOT anything like the John Russo novel, but playing the film for laughs was a surprising success! Clu Gulager was my favorite actor in that one. ""You did WHAT? You OPENED it? You stupid moron, you idiot, whatthehellsamatter with ya, Frank? Haven't I told you never even to go NEAR those goddamn tanks?!"" ||| This mess deserves a whole new classification - ""Zombie Cheese"". This turkey has ZERO artistry, and was made just to make a buck and cash in on the 3D mania sweeping cinemas these days. VERY disappointing, and a slap in the face to the original Romero film, and Savini's respectful reboot. ||| @stepityo ""Send more cops!"" lol  I'll check those out that you recommended, I have seen some old zombie movie called ""Zombie"" by some Italian director that was more bore than gore but have you seen ROTLD part 2?   Not quite as good as the first one but still good...
 ||| @shadowman2192 ROTLD is horror-camp at its best! ""Send...More...Paramedics!"" The Best! Try to see ""The Dead""! Its not campy and has a very surreal feel to it. Like early in , L4D the series. I'm a Resident Evil kind of freak myself! Love getting creeped out! Also, there's a film called, Zombie: Undead. Cheesy title, but worth a Sunday afternoon view. Have you heard of/seen, a Japanese release that is supposed to be really incredible? Its Tokyo Apocalypse, or something? Aim for the head,dude! ||| @stepityo If your in the mood for a campy hilarious yet well made American zombie classic I highly recommend ""Return of the Living Dead"". Its one of my all time favorites aside from Romero's Dead films...Yeah I watched every episode of ""The Walking Dead"", amazing show although I could do without all the love triangle bullshit drama but still a great show...I've seen ""Zombie Diary"" and ""The Horde"" they weren't bad...
Everytime I watch a Z movie I have to play L4D 2 right after lol. ||| @shadowman2192 Damn those Censors!! LOL!! Thus far, the 3 best Zombie films I've seen are ""The Horde"", ""Zombie Diary""- series, & ""The Dead"". Sad that non of these are American-made. But, they're full of gore-galore, lots of end of the world satire, & heads a plenty poppin'! Check them out if you get the chance! Also, the Walking Dead series is one of the most well thought out ""Z"" ideas since the original NOTLD! ||| @stepityo The sensors totally raped it because Savini had some really sweet zombie head shots that got cut out for being to violent and they wouldn't allow and munch-out scenes like you said, why the hell would the sensors care about blood and guts in a zombie movie?  They're already dead so anything goes! lol ||| @Ryanyarb24 what are hyper ADD movements? ||| @shadowman2192 I agree totally! The only drawback to the 1990 remake was the lack of ""munch-out"" scenes! The newer Dawn of the Dead was pretty well-done too! ||| @AkumaADemoncus i dont think it was the zombie, one of the otheer living persons might have a phone and is able to text her. THINK BOY THINK!!! ||| ""COMING 4 U BARB !""
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... ||| @AkumaADemoncus XD the idea of a zombie txting..... LOL ||| is this film as shitty as it looks???? ||| For some ""strange"" reason I know I'm never going to see this film.  ||| Way to go screwing a classic. ||| I saw this movie and it is total low budget shit and a disgrace to the original classic ""Night of the living dead""....If you wanna see a good remake, see the 1990 remake of ""Night of the living dead"" directed by horror legend Tom Savini,
he did a great job with it. ||| is this a remake? ||| like with most attempts to conquer the genre it sucks unbelievable donkey dick ||| @Ryanyarb24 That's not true. The 1990 remake is better than the original. ||| @VictorVonFox yeah why should zombie be left out of the texting fun :) ||| This was a DUMBASS MOVIE ||| the zombie texted?  ||| Romero Style Zombies.  Just the way I like em : ) ||| @sp1derfan90 iv seen zombies use cameras, walkie talkies, and guns before.....so it was only a matter of time before they learned to text ||| they should have never maid this.. ||| @Piratekitty91 HAHA dude, i thought the same :D:D Crazy shit:D ||| Why would they even name it after one of the best zombie movies? ||| @sp1derfan90 I know! I was like, wait.... wtf?! o.o ||| I've been watching horror movie trailers all freaking day and this is the best one I've seen so far. Thanks for uploading, dude!! ^^ ||| hmm.... that doesnt seem like Night Of The Living Dead Origins that ive been reading about.... considering Tony Todd is to reprise his role as Ben, Joe Pilato is to be casted (for all you nuts who dont know who he is, he is Captain Rhodes from Day Of The Dead) and Danielle Harris is to be Barbera (Jamie Lloyd from the Original Halloween franchise).  ||| Shouldn't this be renamed - brainless republicans coming for the poor and middle class? ||| low budget crap
 ||| 0:43 is creepy

they should've made the whole trailer like that, along with just the dude in red talking. i hate how they show too much in trailers ||| @itsybitsyzombie Yeah sorry my bad, i was looking for the upcoming movie and clicked on this and thought this was the one :)  ||| @0MAR5AL1NA5 This one was released in '06.

 ||| @2k99999 I would take a desert eagle for pistol,an M4A1 for rifle,PSG-1 for sniper ||| I like slow moving zombies that can text
woohoo!!! ||| I have a question...If there were real zombie apocalypse:
1) Where would you hide?
2)What wepon would you chose ( 1 pistol and 2 rifles)
3)Who would you take with you? ||| @sp1derfan90 

It's one of the other characters texting her, not zombie. Fuck me, I hate that I know that. This movie was pure shit.   ||| This movie was so stupid, it actually made my dick hurt. ||| wheres tech n9ne?? ||| @Rasberryapples He should make a Resident Evil movie, like he was originally going to before they went with the Anderson script. WHY! I want a Resident Evil movie! ||| looks old....
 ||| No Black Guy!? You can tell movie's gonna suck... ||| @excelx213 They aren't 'destroying' anything. They making a modern remake of the originals, attracting today's generation to the classics. Whats wrong with that? ||| @loco6336 idiot ||| night of the leaving dead 3d wen is it wanna be released on theaters? or is there even this movie true...
 ||| ERM,,,,,Not heard anything about this movies exictence. Would defo watch it coz the original sucked ||| not even worth the time to download. ||| can any1 tell me if this is even worth watchin or not? ||| @excelx213 lol too scary for ya with all the new special effects? ||| Dooooooooh! What was this shit? Why do people make these films, can't they tell how shitty they are? Its like ""Oh boy, we really are fucking this classic movie up, but its 3 weeks into filming and we MIGHT get a pay check from this!"" May these people boil in excrement for eternity.. ||| OH man ... good MOVIES deserve GOOD remakes  , not THIS shit ||| maybe if they didn't fucking call it night of the living dead i would wanna see it! cause it looks like a decent movie...i'm gonna get hated on i just know it lol ||| i know why they always chang the classics, its so the dont have to pay to make a remake cuz its so dam diffrent
 ||| @Marknarcotic no black guy in his right mind would play the part.... ||| WTF IS THIS?!?! NO BLACK GUY?! ||| @excelx213 That is why you remake the crappy movies, like ""the being"" ||| it has its moments too scare but I preffere the 1968 version ||| @luigiblox  i prefer the 1990 remake... but i agree that this one sucks ||| This movie was written by a YouTube user named MetaBob ||| wowww...that really looked craptacular! ||| oh jesus this trailer is poisoning my mind.

Here let's make a remake of a classic movie get shitty actors no plot line dark sets poor dialogue add some 3-D to it and it'll be great! 
it's alright to remake a classic with the right people but to do it half assly takes away the credibility to the original ||| why do such a rubbish film 3d :l   why not remaster the old 1 :) ||| Why... why touch something that good. I mean just the other day me and my friends were talking about what movie they might remake and i said this one would be a good remake... but not like this.
You guys took such a great movie classic and turned it into a... lame crapy film.

I'm a Muslim and I believe Jesus was the purest man in all creation (Virgin Mary was the purest woman) who will return as our Messiah... But he was still created as a man, with man's feelings.  That's what makes him all the more heroic to me. ||| PELICULON!!! ||| Ne lupetaj! Film je antihriscanska holivudska propaganda... ||| odličan film, scenarij  ||| I actually don't know why people are still hating this film. I'm Roman Catholic, but I know the movie is just a fictional portray of Jesus' life. Willem Dafoe's performance as Jesus was amazing, its music is one of the best movie soundtracks I've ever listened, and I can say it's one of the best films of Martin Scorsese ||| If anything it sheds a favorable light in it's portrayal of Jesus. It shows that he was faced with sins which he overcame. ||| @Rangel316 have you even seen the movie?

This movie depicts Jesus in a highly bad way and is a straight insult to christianity in whole, Jesus is the one christians are striving to be like, the salvation and messiah, the ideal of perfection.. i hate this movie because it is straight blasphemy from hollywoods antichrist propaganda ||| R.I.P. Jesus. ||| @fotsifotsi hahaha eladara ||| Thank you @UndeadOutbreak! I certainly want tot see that! In fact, I would like to see any movie defined as blasphemy by the religious zombie nation ||| @senorsalazar You think Gods don't have flaws themselves? ||| @UndeadOutbreak This movie is total blasphemy. No wonder it was banned in certain countries.  It shows Jesus making crosses for the Romans to crucify Jews and having human weakness: being  fearful, doubtful, depressed and reluctant.  It also depicts Jesus imagining himself in sexual activities. There are also depictions of nudity. A lot of it is fiction and not  Bible-based but rather some novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis.

The idea of Jesus is that he didn't, even though he was presented with option too MORE than we are even. Given we are subject to more in a given day than Jesus was though I imagine. My temptations as an average american are. Lust after women, be lazy and over eat, etc. Jesus was presented the option to be king of all the nations at that time if he sinned. He turned it down like an absolute baller. ||| @Mirani2 Hey, the day Hollywood decides to make a ""true"" depiction of Jesus is the day all of Hell will have frozen over! Forgive me for saying so, but it ain't happening! ||| I am Catholic and I love this movie. Some of it's kinda bullshit, but for the most part it was wonderful. It makes you think about who Jesus really was and the struggles that he faced on earth. He often questions who is and why he's doing what he's doing, and everyone keeps asking him why he's not living like an average joe- with a wife, children, and a steady job. For me this is a very powerful message and makes me think a lot about how it applies to my life. That's a sign of a great movie. ||| one of the weirdest movies
i have ever seen.don't really know
what to make of it! ||| Another blonde haired blue eyed Jesus, just what we need!  JK! lol. ||| @indiangoku This is a very underrated comment. thumbs up! ||| This movie made me fall in love with Willem Dafoe, the most romantic portrayal of Jesus ever. ||| Judas in this movie is good and serves jesus instead of betraying him  ||| Im surprised DeNiro didnt play jesus ||| Pf...

Personally, I think portraying Jesus as regular human is much more respectful than showing him being flagellated to death for two hours. ||| i love this music ,god awesomeeeeee ||| @Estelleeeeee t o r r e n t z ||| @Estelleeeeee t o r r e n t  z ||| @baredd79 hahahahaha! well said! ||| it might have happened... only Jesus would know ||| ... ||| can u tell me plz if i can find it somewhere?? ||| @BornToDie90 Thanks for your help. ||| Wiki states: 
Like the novel, the film depicts the life of Jesus Christ, and its central thesis is that Jesus, while free from sin, was still subject to every form of temptation that humans face, including fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust. This results in the book and film depicting Christ being tempted by imagining himself engaged in sexual activities, a notion that has caused outrage from some Christians. ||| Though I have not read the book nor saw the movie, from what I have read it actually portrays Jesus in a more human way rather than more divine and being tempted by human desires which jesus imagines himself (in the movie), cont... ||| @BornToDie90 Oh and what's the nature and message, that it would actually be against Christians? I thought it was for Christians ||| @BornToDie90 Watya mean exactly man? ||| Willem Dafoe's feet are sexy. ||| @voyance4elle JESUS CHRIST!! ||| what is this all about? xD ||| True... after all the US is a mix of cultures so we must be able to get along.. ||| well... thats great:) the more people ungroup culturally or nationally, more peaceful the world will become. ||| Well, what's importante is that you're happy. When people start realizing that, they become more accepting of your choice. I myself don't follow anything specific, I'm more spiritual than anything else. A have friends from all walks of life and there's an understanding between all of us. Nobody offends anyone when we're all together and nobody tries to convert each other. It works for us. ||| yeah people are muslim but the youth dont care much about religion etc. we celebrate new year blah blah. we are not islamic fanatics like arabic countries. however i've studied qoran first. then i studied bible. I have seen the truth about both. then i decided. it was pretty easy for me but hard for others around me:) ||| Wow.. damn. Why did you convert? I think you're Turkish, and in Turkey the main religion is Muslim, right? Well, if you believe in what you're doing than people have to accept you and embrace you the way you are. I'm sure it was dificult for you but you stuck with it. Pretty strong. God bless you for your courage. ||| ok fine. no problem. i hate people who force each other for beliefs, political ideas etc. we people are forgetting what we have in common. we are all human. i have had many difficulties when becoming a christian after having a muslim life for 20 years. my family made me really sad because of what i believe. and i hate it. i never forced them to become a christian as i do. i never told them a verse from bible. world is full of irony. u know... ||| Fine, I respect your beliefs. I did not in ANY way referred to you personally in any of my outbursts. Believe me, I'm the last person in the world poiting a finger at anybody. I'm very accepting of all religions, races, nationalities... soccer teams..etc... You really are confusing me. I might not have been clear expressing myself, but I don't judge anyone in any matter UNLESS it affects me personaly. Then my friend, it's a whole diferent story... believe me. ||| believe me you are insulting. first you call my belief as a ""bullshit on bible"". then you call me as an irrational person. whatever. i really dont want to argue. if you have questions or other things we can discuss. but dont be prejudiced. i dont like arguing or insulting too. ||| Once again we're lost in translation. When I said I didn't want to argue I meant I didn't want to fight, to insult. I didn't mean I didn't want to discuss the matter. Fine, we don't meet eye to eye but don't twist my words. ||| i did not tell anybody like ""you have to believe this"". i've just commented on the video and had some conversation with other people who replied. thats all! if you want to share your opinions and when somebodyelse shares theirs, you cannot say ""i dont want to argue"", ""dont tell me what to do blah blah..."". what you want? u want me to say ""ok this guys says this to me but i will stay silent!"". funny xD ||| in that case you can just comment without replying to me... Everybody knows that there are different people and different beliefs. you have replied me and I have replied to you. and you said i dont want to argue blah blah. if you dont want to argue just dont reply... what you want is something funny. somebody says hello. you reply by saying hello then when you are asked ""how r u?"" u say dont talk to me... i dont want to! FUNNY. im not nervous btw... ||| Damn.... easy!!! Don't get nervous!! When did I attacked you? I think we're having trouble debating this matter. For some reason we're not understanding each other. All I wanted to say from the beginning is that I don't believe he was this miracle worker people claim he was, to me he was just a man. That's all. Why get all nervous about it?.. NO, I don't get it... ||| i am not telling you what to believe:S i just shared my opinion. and you attacked. when i offended my idea you say ""i dont want to argue"". i am a rational person too. dont insult me! i have enough reasoning to study science... actually i cant see any reasoning in your behavior. why the hell do you attack someone if you dont want to argue??? i did not tell anyone believe this or that or some other thing... its all up to you!  HOPE YOU GOT IT NOW? ||| Don't tell me what to believe!! To me and to the rest of the rational people around the world he was a man...and no man is sinless!!! ||| ""He wasn't sinless... HE WAS A MAN!!!! "" what is this? you say what you believe is wrong! then you say i dont want to argue... whatever. bye! ||| I don't want to argue, I hate arguing. Maybe I'm confusing what you're saying. I'm a little lost here. I thought u were saying for me not to reply and I was wondering why. Ok, forget everything and God bless you. Have a good weekend. ||| you are replying in a way that blames my expressions. you shouldn't do it that way if you don't want to argue... right? I dont get the point... ||| Why shouldn't I reply? Did it upset you? I don't get it. I was stating my opinion like you stated yours. One of the great blessings of the free world is that we can express ourselfs. ||| but dont forget that if someone does evil in name of religion i think that, that person is a non believer. because no true religion commands evil things. and no true religion commands to force people in believing itself. first of all we are all human and we have laws in common. religion is something special to every individual in a community. thats why i just replied to you. i believe this is fair. and if you think so why did you replied? i dont understand. ||| I don't want to argue with anybody. I just think that religion blinds people into comitting awful acts and then excusing themselfs with it.... and others also excusing them and sometimes even applauding what they do, only because they say it was done in name of religion. You have your opinion, I have mine. That's fair. ||| the concept of sin is known since the time of philosopers. base concept for sins are ethical values. these things you say are all evil. and all evil things are blamed in bible! those are known as sin. and if you go on with these arguements believe me that  you wont come to anywhere. then i will reply with who the hell is to say there is no one to decide what is a sin or not. to a murderer killing is not a sin! then there comes chaos! ||| I understood. Only somebody with inteligence is able to combine both names and make a good point. You sound like a very  interesting person. You must do a lot of research or reading. Are u from the States? ||| I am not saying their acts are comparative
or equal. This is a very disturbing concept,
it requires awareness and understanding.

Think and feel the concept, 'beyond good
and evil'. It is not a mantra to excuse the
will of the ego, but it might help to explain
the purpose of life and why we are here.

Gnostic, felt Christ's greatness, was he
understood the illusion. Check out also
Buddha's realization, that 'we are all asleep' ||| Damn, cant believe u put Hitler in the same sentence with Mother Theresa. But I respect your opinion.. It's all good. ||| BUT, the purpose of life, for a man, is
understanding and awareness.

Man's trip to enlightenment and 'rejoining' his Creator, is beyond 'good or evil', whether Hitler or Mother Tereasa.

'All the world is a stage, and each must
play their part...' 

Don't judge the players, life is an illusion,
but our insights are real!

And the Prime Mover, is not Santa Claus,
who watches whether you are 'naughty
or nice'!  and then rewards or punish! ||| this McNugget guy must be on ecstasy tripping.... what a dope!!! ||| He wasn't sinless... HE WAS A MAN!!!! There is nothing wrong with living a normal life.... Who the hell is to say what is a sin and what isn't?? To me a sin isn't that bullshit on the bible, to me a sin is damn child molesters, murderous, rapists, is people not having what to eat, where to sleep,... That's a sin!!! ||| Try typing The last temptation of Christ part 1 and click on the link. I dont know the quality of the video but at last u can watch the movie. That's crazy that blockbusters near u dont carry the movie, it's a great movie. Martin Scorsese is a GENIUS. ||| Jesus was a looney. ||| if u watch the movie u'll see. this movie shows jesus living a human life as u have just confirmed. merrying, making love with many women. having dozens of children blah blah... isnt it what mohammed did and many muslims claim that jesus will return and then merry and have lots of children. that's a lie. jesus is sinless! the one that every christian wants to be like. ||| i was an ex muslim... i studied qoran and then bible. then i decided not to act like an ignorant asshole anymore and became a christian. ||| perfect movie... just shows what muslims think about jesus christ is same as the plans of devil... LOVE YOU JESUS! my best friend... ||| what do you guys think about the movie and how much is it ||| @TranshumanCyborg  have you seen Jesus of Nazareth? by far the best film about Jesus' life ever made. ||| This is Pasolini... ||| You obviously don't know your bible very well.  It expressly states that, befor Jesus began his ministry, he was taken out into the desert and left for 40 days and 40 nights.  After this, he was TEMPTED TO SIN by the Devil ||| A very believable take on an ancient dogmatic head fuq. ||| No.  Don LaFontayne ||| he had no sin, but was tempted. he did not give into temptation. ||| Good  point man.  That movie was fucking dynamite. Taxi Driver is my favorite movie of all time. He's probably the most influential American director of all time. ||| Hahahaha, then why are we arguing? Martin Scorsese is a fucking genius. ||| That racist sexist shit is in the old one. The new one does say I don't bring peace I bring the axe though. It's also an astrological map of the stars. ||| One of my favourite movies of all time. ||| Because a number of Christians cannot stand anything that tests or questions their faith, while others openly embrace such challenges. ||| why was this film so controversial? ||| Scorsese's best film. ||| love the ending on the credits one of the very few films that display a color instead of the normal black screen/i think it was orange/movie is good one scene near the end has slow pace but wait for the end its so worth it  john 3:16 ||| This is FAN FICTION. I don't see why people get so offended. It's not meant to be portrayed as true; I think anyone who walks out of this film believing it is retarded; that's like walking out of ""Star Trek"" and saying ""So THAT'S how to make a ship go at the speed of light!""",0.1366389035098836,0.9884568452835084,10,1,0.1,100

As Oskar roams the city, he encounters a motley assortment of humanity, who are all survivors in their own ways. Ultimately, Oskar's journey ends where it began, but with the solace of that most human experience: love.",movie,856881.0,4553.0,244,PT2M29S,"I cry when I think about how she never got to hear the voicemails 😭😭😭 ||| Just saw this for the first time now. What outstanding acting from this young man. Cried my eyes out 😢 ||| CUUUUUTTTTEEEEEEE I never watched this when they made it a movie ||| Little boy looks like Evan rachel wood ||| WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME. ||| What disability does Oskar Schell have? ||| I remember watching the trailer to this movie in the cinema before the movie I was going to watch started. For just a couple minutes everyone stopped talking and movie when the scene of the plane showed. Even if 9/11 happened 10 years before it definitely traumatized many. It was so eerily quiet during the trailer. ||| Two of my most favorite actors on the same movie. Tell me I'm dreaming! ||| I’m reading the book right now and I can’t wait to watch the movie. Based on the comments here, should be amazing. 🤞🏼 ||| The kid Thomas Horn disappeared after this film

Never seen him since 

PS came here after 23 years of “The Worst Day” 

This was the first movie about 9/11 I discovered. Saw the trailer in We Bought A Zoo.

In memory of the fathers, sons, mothers, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, best friends, colleagues, and relatives who we all lost on 9/11 ||| But im afraid ||| Thought provoking and skilfully done - with Tom Hanks making a sharp exit early on and me warming to Sandra Bullock as to her hardened exterior, her crafty way of explaining past events from her perspective to put a different slant on the movie makes her worth a cuddle. What I felt particularly heart breaking in this movie was the account of the live recording to voice message in real time to the collapse of the world trade centre on TV - it makes me wonder how many people actually had that experience ||| Beautiful movie ||| Chris Chan has seen this film you fools ||| A movie that emerges from the terrorist act by the U.S government. 💩💩💩💩💩 ||| Critic reviews on this movie are bullshit. Literally one of the best films ive ever seen. Thomas Horne is remarkably talented 👏 ||| ufff no la he visto pero la tengo en pendiente ||| I've been reading the book and now I talked abt it with my parents, we gonna watch it when we get home ||| I don't know if I want to watch this movie.  It looks beautiful, but I don't think I can make it through it ||| Heavy boots ||| I’m only gonna watch the movie if there is no more U2 in it ||| This movie killed me..  I love this movie.. This movie would make the toughest man cry… ||| For some reason, the camera clicks and some of the people he visited at 1:40 is my favourite part of this ||| I believe in this movie thr kid is autistic incredibly intelligent who was very close to his daddy because he understood him more than his mother did ia why he misses him greatly. It's sad to ever miss a daddy and a mommy regardless 😢
What a great movie although; love it 💯 ||| They couldn’t even bother getting period-correct cars for the outdoor scenes, something that bothered me a lot while watching the movie ||| I love Hanks..every film he is in I watch ||| fiyuuuuuuuuuuuyyyy plane comingggg

✈✈✈✈✈ ||| l'm never watch this before is was garet film ever l had seen ||| Read the book, ending was a little underwhelming but just seeing this trailer I do not want to watch this movie ||| If there's a _key,_ there must be a _lock._ ||| This movie is amazing. Why on Earth did it not do better,  why in the world are the rotten tomatoe scores so bad? Seriously what is wrong with people? It can't just be bc of the odd title. The movie is too good to have been largely ignored. That kid did an amazing job. My only gripe is this U2 song should have also been in the movie. ||| What a brilliant film!!!! I cant remember When last time i cried while watching a movie. I give it 12 out of 10. What an amazing story!!! ||| Why is this book being banned in public schools? ||| such a sad beautiful movie ||| I think this film is underrated. ||| I want to see more movies like this. Children going on adventures, doing things teens and grown ups have do. ||| I was waiting for the swing set to break at the end. ||| OMG if I had a spoiled neurotic brat like that ... 😡 ||| Nice ||| Last time I saw this was 10 years ago. I saw it again tonight. A hidden gem is an understatement. I cried so much you guys. I cried SO MUCH. It’s such a beautiful film. It’s officially made the list of one of my favorite movies of all time. Also I’ve never seen the trailer. Not even now as I type this. I hope you all loved it as much as I did. I hope to watch it with someone who appreciates it as much as I do someday. ||| 😘😉♥️ ||| I'm on the austim spectrum i see the world differently. I can relate to this kid. ||| I see the world like this kid in the movie ||| This is my favorite 49 movie of all time ||| Thomas Horn is a terrific actor. Not easy for someone his age to give this kind of intense portrayal.  Bravo Thomas ! ||| Brilliant movie ||| For some reason my AP Literature teacher really dislikes this movie ||| Not saying this is a bad trailer but it definitely doesn't do the movie justice ||| The longest nut  in my throat that a movie has given me. ||| movie is much better than book ||| Can you help me to get the book please? ||| This video was when I wasn't even born yet (WHAT) ||| I remember watching this movie in a trip long ago. All this time I thought it was a dream of mine 😂 ||| incredibly stupid movie! vomit ||| I watched this on my television. The fk why i have tears now ||| Putting trailers together must be one of the coolest jobs on earth. I give this trailer a 10 ||| I only watched the trailer and I'm sobbing already 😭 ||| How did I not watch this yet ||| I was 22 years old on the clear one day when the planes hit the World Trade Center I lived in Brooklyn and I stepped out of my apartment that I saw a sight that I will never forget for the rest of my life....people who fathers mothers sisters brothers daughters and sons go to work that day and never come home again because of a senseless act of brutal terrorism..may God bless and keep all the heroes and victims of that horrible day ||| The film has autism teachings too ||| Incredible cast, except for the kid. He almost made the movie insulting.
Can you burn tambourines? If so, his would be the first to go. ||| Looks and feels good. . Great music choice....Where the streets have no name....U2. ||| Just watching the trailer makes me bawl. Such a moving story told by an excellent cast. ||| Poor kid! ||| Just read the book it was amazing. This trailer (and I bet the movie) does the art I read 0 justice. I don’t usually read but god damn it was an incredible book. ||| I Never Realized This Had 9/11 In It And I Want To Read The Book Now ||| one of my favourite movies ever. i have never loved a fictional child more than Oscar. ||| Why have I never heard of this movie? ||| Watch it!
It's great! ||| WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME.  SUPERBOWL IN MEMORIAM OF 9/11. Tom Hanks really thought this soundtrack ||| Like jermy fink ||| Hope that kid got coronavirus too ||| Great movie to watch whilst on the toilet with diarrhea ||| Best performance I have seeen from a kid in a movie. ||| I love the book ||| It talks about an adventurous empath who craved to find his place in this overwhelming world? ||| This movie got a lot of toxic buzz when it was released, mainly because it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture and many critics denounced this and said it wasn't good enough to deserve a nomination. I saw the movie and it turned out being not bad at all. It was a bit sentimentalised and mawkish at times, but nonetheless an emotional film and an insightful look at seeing the world through a different lens. ||| I finished the book last night, I was to try the movie. But seeing Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock, it's not what I've imagined and the trailer is a bit off than the mood the book gives. I guess I should pass it so the book can stay with me? ||| Was looking for this movie, I remember it vaguely but I remember I enjoyed it. ||| I’m watching this right now ||| this trailer doesn’t do this movie justice at all this is by far one of the most beautiful movies i’ve seen ||| Sorry but this movie was so bad and boring ||| The father is Woody 🤠 ||| Any one else who’s lost a father at a young age and finished this movie is someone I truly respect. Those of us who know, know. ||| Redbox ||| I haven’t seen the movie, I came here to see the comments as I knew people who saw the movie would be here, and the reviews talk about pretentiousness. Reviews mention it is Oscar-bait, emotional blackmail, and that the trailer is not only misleading but better. 

I came here for input. 

I also heard the movie was heartwarming and something we all needed. 

So I ask, and keep in mind I came here for input on the movie (and NOT myself),  what did you think of it? ||| I wonder how many in  New York has heavy boots right now... ||| Bullock and Viola? Oh lord ||| I just watched the trailer and it made me cry ||| Just wanted to say its not about religion its about the person its doesn't matter what religion you are its about the person you are, you harm other people and then if you have a religion people blame that religion and if you don't have a region people are like oh this happend and that its called humanity, i  believe that their are good people in the world and bad people in the world that's it simple has that. ||| I haven’t watched this in a few years but just the trailer had me sobbing all over again. This film was so beautifully done. ||| The kid was so annoying. The entire time I was yelling at the screen to just go talk to his mom and stop running around bothering people. He was very rude, bossy and selfish. Couldn't stand the kid. And I don't know what the big deal was about 9/11, get over it. ||| The movie was alright i guess but i still wont get it all i know is his dad die or something but i remember me and my puppy are watching this movie and just panic for som reason .-.,  but this movie was a bit good ||| Just finished the book today 😍 it's
B R I L L I A N T ||| After watching this movie, I will always cried while watching this trailer! ||| Bro... i was way too young to understand this movie ||| thats weird i never heard of this movie before ||| The book is way better ||| THERES A MOVIE?? ||| i think the movie is great, but this song doesn't fit in there, what a waste..",0.0798089579050429,0.99089515209198,7,1,0.07,100

No healthy player would announce their retirement with the end of Wimbledon. There is the US open always scheduled a month later, a chance to make tons of cash for simply competing.

Pretty smart, if a little mean-spirited. ||| I love being a computer nerd just don't know what to expect from wish all I can say is u can wish it can works 😂 ||| This video was funny ||| 19:19 it's...also kinda not though. Mac and Unix style keyboards have the GUI key right next to the space then comes the Alt/Option key then of course Ctrl. This one has the windows style layout: Alt key next to space THEN the Gui (Command) key, which is more like a windows keyboard, except yea it has Command instead of windows. So like on a macbook it it's Ctrl--Opt--Command--space ||| I've had that mouse it was really good for a while then it broke beacuse I touched the sensor just slightly like it just stopped working ||| man if you dont have optical drive, you are missing out! ||| He just paid $400 for a dell optiplex! ||| I found a quadro k4000 for $400 USD on wish ||| Cut the music, please! ||| i just went gonnnu ||| maybe they 're really calling their customers the ""buffoon"" ||| this is someones life right now...

I'm not even joking I use the same one and I use it for EVERYTHING!! They are awesome (well mine is and it looks like the same one) they are tiny but suprisingly strong ive been using mine for like a year and it hasn't worn at all I dont know what kind if steel they are made from but the end has not stripped at all! Even the all metal ones you get in a set (with the black harden steel tips) usually wear down and get stripped off by really hard screws, but that thing and I kid you not looks brand new and I have been using it for over a year. you should get those steel cores and re-brand them as LTTSTORE I'm not even kidding LOL best mini screwdriver EVER! I cant even remember where mine came from probably with some crap like that but I use it daily. I almost want to buy that ram kit now just for the screwdriver because like I said I forget where it came from ): Probably a genaric amazon thing but thats the first one i've seen that looks like mine its got like three rings and a squared end like a bolt they look so cheap But I love it to death. I kid you not I've taken apart somany laptops with it they are awesome!!! My bad I remember now its from a glasses repair kit if you look up (Glasses Screws Sets,Spectacles Mini Glasses Nuts Generic -) on goo images they come up. im serious re brand them they are the best for little laptop screws in case and what internally, They actually handle bigger screws than you think. ||| hey its better than nothing right? ||| 19:13 LOL headphones didn't last long ||| Greetings from Poland ||| That ground is used in Japan yah also its 50 or 60 year old still used in Japan tho ||| I watched the rtx 5090 review after this to help Linus ||| As for having an ""optical bay"" - I like them as you can fit 4 removable 2.5"" drives in them. My current case has 3 ""opical bays""
one of which has an actual optical drive in it. The other 2 house 8 2.5"" drives.
The housings take one power in per 4 drives. So it helps with cable management.
One bay of 4 is in RAID, the other is set up as individual drives...making upgrading easy. ||| That PC case is totally a ripoff from the legendary Coolermaster Elite 361, the best early slim PC case you could do with full ATX and full ATX PSU. You could even use K CPU´s if you got the early Deepcool 80mm x2-3 fan. I rocket 5GhZ contunies boost on a i5 4690k back in the days. ||| the rugs from the sposner are very nice! ||| I had a pc build I replaced like 8 years ago that did have screws in the board to hold ram in. Never saw that again. Little guy kept up with new releases for a little over a decade somehow though. The ram for it even had little circle wings to screw in. ||| at the end of the day, this used to be better than my old gaming/editing pc, my old pc had a i3-2330, gt710 4gigs of ddr3 ram and was made in 2008 ||| GT 1030 unplug for better performance 😂 ||| God loves you and has a plan for your life ||| Game Office dong ||| optiplex anyone? ||| It's obviously some sort of an HTPC case. ||| $420...ironic...cuz you'd have to be REALLY high to pay for that! 😂 ||| LOL that moment at 21:15  the sounds is true horror to get from a Pc but at that moment who gives a crap you just [ WIshed ] you care of the pc - aka wish stuff is pretty crappy if you want to buy crap go there ofc :D ||| Kortishibu (from what I heard is a trusted Japanese gpu manufacturer ||| 7:32 I assume that they sell both ddr3 and ddr4 memory and for some reason they use the same box for both ||| 1:24 oof thats worth than my 4790 ||| 7:37 save point :D ||| Linus I love your vids I’ve been watching your vids and they help out a lot ||| those rugs look like shit ||| no way i got the exact same headset and mouse ||| 21:15 listen to that lions roar 🔥🔥 ||| 4:10 AMD is the the top dog again ||| Is this just me or is Linus skin yellow?😂 ||| 11:20 yooo that’s japanese! that line there is “earth” or basically ground, because we don’t have the smiley face on the plug :) ||| i can just smell that packaging from parts ||| $420 for the price makes sense cause you'd have to be high to intentionally buy any of these components ||| Bruh this pc is beter then mine😭 ||| anyone else stopped the video when the motherboard fell of the case and think that the bush in the room was a marijana plant ?:)))) ||| Deram, memory you dream about. ||| ""When AMD was the top dog""

Q1'25. system only cost me £184 but 3 years insurance £197 in total so very good buy. add a screen 2.5k 16 inch it feels well built and pictures great only for £137 but that was with 38% off so £82 discount, mouse and keyboard £20 and a 12v inverter with 50hz output i now have a car pc for my travels. whole system uses around 40w , that is insane for the performance the monitor uses 10w but it has a grade A for energy, and computer has 12v 3a plug but to be safe as im sure it would work from 12v car port an inverter what puts out steady 50hz. whole setup less than £350 it a huge upgrade to my old travel laptop a 15 year old dell and it has bonus very fast for lightroom and photoshop and big bonus uses so little power i could use it in my car, windows 11 pc what i can edi using lightroom in my car pretty happy with that and i can play 2x 4k screens what not bad at all but 2.5k plenty as that max i rec in due to file sizes. seeing you wish and other cheap builds it makes this mini pc look great value and more usable as can see it many more places, even top mountain with a great office view. yes the cpu a mobile / notepad chip but it runs all the software i require its fast for it size and crazy low power, im so impressed im tempted to get an amd one for a home computer so to give my pc pc a rest as no point running a huge pc loads energy just wearing it out when 90% of the time just watching vids online and mini pc can do that on top most daily stuff so big pc and rest till i need it for bigger tasks ||| Cool ||| ""Without the padding they're even worse"" No sh!t! ||| with that GPU i think this computer needs a cBab machine just to barely live ||| China: *makes garbage products""

This section is just awful. but hay it's fromsoft so just ignore all the horrendously awful stuff and focus on the good parts I guess. To this day ds1 and bloodbourne are their best games no question about it. And ds1 wasn't even finished. ||| Dude slow down useless guide ||| The 3X speed was an interesting choice, shit may of been 5X speed. I had it at half speed and it was still going so fast that it was hard to recognize where he was going cause everything’s white and looks the same. Also the bow guys are massive and should have been mentioned. They’ll shoot your right off multiple ladders ||| Are you serious to make this video with speed 2x? ||| Use the Lion Greatbow to kill the archers from the 3rd candle spot. You will hit them 1 time each and they will fall from their roof ||| Maybe don't play the video at high-speed, then we can get some bearings... ||| the crepus vial is better than the armor set ||| You say it as ""Jail"" ||| Worst walkthrough ever ||| my favorite part is where you take the route with the most agro catching and waste our time making us watch you get old runes and random items ||| This is literally the worst puzzle in any video game ||| Unseen Form are very useful to avoid the invisible asshole ||| this gotta be one of the worst puzzles in this game ||| Mabye don’t speed it up times fucking ten and we could follow ts ass wipe ||| Thank you ||| This makes me feel like im doing a Breath of the Wild shrine. ||| I was actually able to ranged battle all the archers but the last one.  You can cheese them with power shot ash of war by popping up firing a shot for like 500 damage then ducking back out of sight.  They'll fire three times then de-aggro and you can do it again, repeat until they're clear (make sure you equip increased range and damage on arrows).  The last one I had to beat normally but they're damage is still almost entirely physical and deals low stamina damage on block.  As long as you have 100% physical block walk and block is a completely viable strategy to get close as they don't kite you.  You'll take a small amount of chip and can recover your stamina between shots. ||| tHANKS SO MUCH MAN I LÉOVE YOU ||| I had like 45 vigor going into this part and idk if i got lucky but i just kinda juked the archers and it worked then i went on and killed the first archer and lit the candle.
The tough part believe it or not was me trying to find the 4th tower (2nd tower shown in the video) which i had to just look up cause i could not find it for the life of me ||| Thanks ||| It's Stupid that you need 15 str and fai to use a torch.😂 ||| Thank you, multiple hours of struggle avoided ||| You cannot have the torch on your back and it be active in 2025 this information is incorrect you should update it or delete the video you're pissing a lot of people off and I mean tens of thousands of people you're pissing off because the incorrect information ||| Sorry To let you know about this information doesn't help in 2025. ||| Thanks for walking in a big stupid confusing zig zag circle while going to the ladder lol. Very descriptive ||| ""follow this path"" proceeds to speed it up x5 and does a bunch of spinning ||| speed it up a little more i can almost tell what’s happening ||| Me playing Elden Ring:
- How to get here
- How to get here
- How to get here
-How to get this
-How to get that
-How to get the other half of that
- How to unlock secret door
- How to get there
- How to get out ||| I went to a couple of the locations where they're supposed to be a statue to light the candle but there was just an empty pedestal?! ||| This didn't help ||| This location is cancer... ||| Seriously the further you get in this game the more annoying it gets. This shit ain’t even fun anymore. It’s just more jank and unfair crap designed to piss you off ||| To bad if ur not a faith build in anyway the torch is useless ||| Killed her without the toarxh ||| Tip for people without a bow; two hand a greatshield when going across rooftops. Then smack the hell out of the archers when you finally reach them. 
Or; bolt of gransax has pretty good reach to snipe them back ||| Thanks man ||| Feel the pain in his dih💔 ||| I went to the candle places but no candle ? ||| probably the most idiot part of the game ||| I can't even use the torch ||| Their is 3 ||| Very helpful ||| Thanks ||| fork handles? ||| theres just so much shit in this game that seems unnecessarly annoying i dont really get it. this isnt fun lol ||| Love the video and thanks for the help, but do people really ask for it to be sped up or is there some other benefit of missing for you to speed up in advance? We have the option to change the speed within YouTube so I’m honestly just curious. ||| The Black Knife armour is under the arch of the staircase that leads to the final seal to go to the Haligtree ||| Fyi it's ever jail. The old spelling ||| Man that was annoying😂 Thank you this helped a lot! ||| Stop u don't know what ur u walked me into two black knife assaians when there should one on the path I need to go WTF ||| The machine gun archers shooting you on the way up to a ladder you're required to climb was a nice, stupid touch.  👌 ||| For anyone have issues with the black knife archers I was able to knock them off the rooftops by using radahns great bow and the special skill to bombard them from a safe position. ||| You can stand on a rooftoop above the area of the assassin guy and use area damaging spells like Magma shots, the mist magic and magma breath etc. ||| I always forget about the location on the left of the city  its the easiest one and the one I always forget abt ||| ngl it wasnt hard at all. your lack of instructions n u doing one thing just to do the complete opposite thing 5 secs later made it hard to stay with u. i never get why people make tutorials then just confuse tf out ppl ||| Theres also a talisman that quiets your footsteps down i forgot what its called but i think tanith gives it to you after doing a certain amount of invasions for her ||| This is one of the worst videos I’ve ever watched. Absolutely no way to keep up and no detail ||| It’s pronounced everJAIL ||| Walking through the city in Britain: ||| Everything since I got to the snow has sucked. Not fun at all. ||| I didn't use torch, I just used destined death ash of war on malikeths black blade and it had the blackface effect in the air where they were ||| How tf is these archers 2shot me when my level is 230 and have somewhat heavy armor🤦 ||| This doesn't work at all ||| I just used bow) it was hard, but I did it)) ||| do people really have fun with stuff like this? i’d rather have 1 OP boss to try and learn a skill set and actually get better. these little tanky pests with bows and being i bc visible is just straight up un fun. don’t get it sometimes. ||| This guy saved me from albinauric mg42 machine gun nests in those rooftops, dodging them, and felt like elden ring d day ||| Bruh where in the north east is this armor (edit) thanks for telling us we have to get the armor before entering the puzzle ||| Shit guide ||| Whew!  This area is horrible. Thanks for the tips. FYI, in order to equip this torch, you need a faith of 15. ||| whats the hat he is using? ||| Thankyou this was great ||| I snuck around the assassin's/avoided them them then for the archers I equipped a magic dmg resistant talisman and the carian knights shield and their arrows do no dmg or almost none. ||| These bowmen are the bane of my existence ||| I killed Hermit when i got there, so is there any other place i can get that torch?? ||| yah bro let me just put it in 100x when i do the path so you will totally understand ||| Saying you need the armor and that it's found in the town, but not showing it was a cool artistic decision ||| Donnelly Valley ||| not a good ""how to"" video, you didn't mention the archers and the cuts were super confusing. ||| Horrible guide ||| As soon as I got the torch he mentioned. I did it on my 2nd try. 1st try I just tried to kill everything at once, but those assassins don't play 😂. Just pick em off 1 at a time. There are 2 assassins and about 4 archers. Stay safe out there tarnished 🙏 ||| This was paramount in my not losing my damn mind playing this level. Thank you!! ||| Halvorson Walks ||| You are English honey, gaol is the old English spelling for jail. ||| Fk these mf wizards spamming the fin kf ||| used Rahdan bow for the 2 archers and they were sent flying away lol ||| You are WAY WAY to sped up I had to keep rewinding ||| This place in the game is bullshit. The assassins are so fast I cannot kill them, the archers shooting constantly... Typical FromSoftware bullshit way to make a game hard... ||| Thanks ||| I died to the ghost assassin twice and I said ""nah, I'm going on YouTube"". I'm not dealing with that bs ||| Schaden Bypass ||| The relief you get after killing these cold lunatics and they don't respawn after you get killed or revisit the site of grace. Phewwww ||| I didn't even know that the torch existed and it could be helpful in seeing those smooth ass criminals. I've equipped my ash of war storm stomp and put my foot in the ground at every step I took just to caught those little fuckers. And I did. 😂 ||| Thanks for showing  the candle positions in the map. Its was a godsend. Also the items for preparing the run like the torch & blackknight set. Cheers mate. ||| Awful video ||| What sword is that? ||| Jesus christ way to hard i am mevel 110 and ky bleed build barely does shit to these guys da fuq ||| Thank you!!!! ||| You’re guide is genuine garbage with your jagged camera play and speeding things too fast without explaining how to deal with the absolute unfairness of the black knife fucks ||| Nah tbh this was easy. Only the candle on the rooftop is slightly hard. Just roll man roll ||| L tutorial ||| wow they dont die ||| This is the most fucking retarded area of this game, istg whatever creative lead came up with this needs to be fired asap ||| One of the worse walkthroughs I’ve ever watched in all of my runs, and the worst editor how do you go from a slow nice walkthrough to absolutely butchering it by exaggerating the speed of the gameplay on the last 2 ||| To make it easier if you have bolt of gransax. Snipe the archers. For the blacke knives… get some op build or smthn ||| bad video don't waste your time, its clickbait ||| Weak ass guide. ||| Personally my sentry Torch is deactivated once not in my hand ||| These archer B****** are just like the B****** in shrine of amana in ds2 they be just throwing heat tracking shit that follows you and spam it like a machine piss gun ||| Actually not so helpful ||| Worst guide i have seen on this . How tf do you mess up a tutorial for other people then edit amd post it ||| I am never doing this puzzle ever again ||| If your having trouble beating the bowmen, i recommend using fist weapons as they can easily damage their poise. ||| Thanks! Saved me a ton of grief! ||| Thank you so much ||| How are you British and you don’t know Gaol is pronounced jail? You literally invented the language lmao ||| lol just don’t show you grabbing the armor psh ||| For the last tower, I used jar cannon with explosive bolts to knock the archers off the roofs 😂 ||| Who Came from that melenia reach video 😂😂😂😂😂 ||| Thanks I haven't gotten this in the game in years ||| Bloodhound quick step helps with the archers ||| thanks for the video but the loops and jukes and 180s and johny bravo hu has kinda throw you off lol trying to get to the second candle ||| Worst walkthrough out there ||| Fast forwarding while spinning 360’s was so much more harmful than it needed to be. Had to rewind 30 times ||| with this, only took 2 tries ||| What a pain ||| I fucking hate this game. ||| Thank you my friend ||| wayyy too confusing of an area ||| I feel like someone should have said i would need at least 15 faith to fight malenia. ||| Thank you man, legend. ||| that sentrys torch tip working even if you dont have the faith is so clutch. Was stuck on this for days getting frustrated each time, first timed it with this vid. thank you friend. ||| Terrible walk through ||| having it on super speed isnt really ideal when people are trying to follow it ||| Bar none this games worst area ||| Love how you dont show us where to get the armor. Very cool. ||| You might as well turn the camera around even faster and speed up the video even more ||| Your guide sucks slow tf down and go the right way I found all four before your video was done ||| This area proves how terrible the second half of this game is ||| Full Elden Ring DLC boss order: https://youtu.be/KcZEwqK5KmY?si=DiXMAAU8gEtuaqkc ||| Horrible horrible video ||| This part truly made me not want to play anymore lol , it was like right around release and I didn’t have a torch 😭 took me atleast 6 hours lol ||| this is the worst puzzle a game ever made ||| Thank you for the torch tip
I almost broke my controller ||| Pretty sure they nerfed this area. I remember having to light the torches every time when the game first came out. ||| It’s like you gave a perfect intro tutorial and were just like “fuck it”…failed to mention the roof archers, I’m pretty sure there’s more than 2 black knife assassins…just super lazy and annoying shit to see ||| THANKSSSSS ||| This is so bs ||| luckily the video isnt sped up so you can easily follow along to each point huh ||| Another really good talisman for this is the concealing veil ||| A tip for those archers would be to make them spawn then wait for them to stop shooting, stay some safe distance away and shoot them with a greatbow (personally i used the Golem's magic arrows) to knock them off the roofs for easy access ||| Fore anyone else that has problems with the damn archers, quick step and blood hound  step make dodging them easy ||| Gaol is pronounced the same as jail ||| Thanks brother ||| i cant find how to dual wield a sword while the torch is on my back. people talk about things in this game as its common knowledge but this game is anything but. :S ||| This impossible to follow ||| Worst fucking guide, dudes literally wandering in circles and sped up the video ass video ||| Well this was a shit tutorial ||| I don't see the statues ||| It’s pronounced jail. ||| Bro this seems deadass impossible every time I go on a ladder a stupid bow and arrow fuck insta kills me ||| Not gonna lie, i only died once ||| Oh and by the way you have to have faith level 15 to use the torch so you dont get stabbed in the back and lose all your runes ||| Why do you guys speed these videos up the amount of pausing and going back is so unnecessary ||| This is the worse walkthrough ever ||| I one-shot all of the archers with my Spear of Gransax build. I hit harder than them from just as far away. I also 2-shot all of the Black Knife guys. Nice guide. ||| I don't understand how people do this and never talk about it like it's easier than anything else in the game, I can't last the last flame because two fuckers just stand there and keep firing shit that I cannot do anything about WHILE platforming, no spells reach them and I can't even get to them, invisible guys aren't the fucking problem, I deleted the game, glad I didn't buy the dlc yet. They will not be getting more of my money ||| how do you manage to create such a stupid guide? you literally took extra editing effort to make it worse ||| What a useless video ||| Dat sped up wandering around … whyyy ||| Thank you so much!!!! ||| The last statue was broke. ||| Dude lol nah I wanted to u to show how we get to the place not what u do when u get there I mean I appreciate it but I'm still lost I'll check this out later tho still running through the winter landscape ||| God loves you, repent and follow Jesus Christ ||| A walkthrough shouldn’t have cuts or jumps in the film is confuses the watchers and is hard to follow ||| The editing makes this useless. Also please don't go grab worthless items when sped up at 4x speed. We are trying to follow the path bro ||| Do the assassins respawn if you die in the evergaol ||| How do you put it in your back like that ? Everytime I put it away I can’t see them ||| I know this video is two years old but help me thanks lol first time play through and i was like damn i know im doing something wrong ! I was watching the footprints in the snow to fight them lol 😢😂😢 ||| good guide...but you coulda pin pointed the map of each candle we had to light. ||| its not a fucking puzzle just shit game design. ive played this game for 700+ hours and this area is still complete shit. ||| To give him props you can easily just snipe the annoying invisible snipers on the roofs and you don’t have to start over when you die. ||| Well the fact you skipped the route and sped it up is a huge L LMFAO ||| Thanks. I would have found this really tough without this guide.! ||| Too fast..chill, man! ||| thing with the torch exposing them is bullshit ||| For the archers guys. I found head shooting them works fantastic. The one on the right side I head spotted 3 times and knocked it off the rooftop, then I head spotted the one near the final torch, and pushed it back enough so I can run across and melee him until it fell off. Hope this helps!😊 ||| the fucking archers dude, harder than half the bosses in the game ||| One of the worst areas in any game I've ever played. The fact people give this game a 10/10 is mindboggling ||| Why make a tutorial if you wander around not going the right way half the time ||| Thankyou! ||| Thanks for NOT showing me where the armor was... This guy is a dik ||| My torch don’t even show them bruh ||| my horse doesnt work here ||| Thanks very helpful ||| Use a shield to tank the shots ||| This is useless ||| “Gaol” is an archaic spelling of jail.

No Synopsis Available.",movie,9798309.0,28607.0,2188,PT2M31S,"Tolga çevik (sen benim Herşeyimsin) 2016  bence daha güzel anlatılmış izleyin ||| what is it about? ||| The end… ||| i cant believe people don't really like this movie, its just a great movie. ||| INSTANT DADDY! ||| I grew up more real ||| This movie intro to a wall ||| Tell me this wasn't your real rockstar life ||| Like litterally I would have ||| Wasn't being a rockstar back in the day ||| This movie is SO well written OMG ||| Movies dont usually make me tear up like this movie did in the ending, and I'm not even a father yet. Didnt have hihj expectations for this movie but it was definitely worth the watch. ||| Went here after our country (🇵🇭) released an adaptation of this movie. ||| I can’t believe it’s been 10 yrs already! I remember when I first saw this movie it was funny and emotional too, the ending had me crying ||| I love this movie even though I hate how it ended. I was just happy that the girl could see how much her mom wanted her, too in the end. I cried when she saw her mom on the beach after going with her dad and how she ran to her. She really loved her mom 🥺 (so depressing) 

Original story line and character backgrounds ||| Loved it and love it. Americans should learn to be ok with titles. Because they are missing so many great, great movies from around the world! From France, Italy, Russia, Serbia, etc,etc. Learn to focus and stop watching just Hollywood productions .you will enrich your life I guarantee . Cheers to Americans that have no problem with titles. ||| I watched this movie when I was younger. I LOVED IT ❤❤❤ ||| This is also the same story from that Netflix movie ||| This is the greatest clean, honest , love story, just movie, I EVER watched...and I am 92 years old! ||| Idee poco chiare del regista in alcuni tratti del film,un finale molto triste anche perché Valentin oltre alla figlia perde anche il padre (Johnny Bravo) per rimanere da solo con il suo cane ||| best picture ever! lol ||| I cried my eyes out. ||| My friend recommended for me to watch this the other day and it was very good! The best one I’ve seen in awhile. I’m already sensitive as is so you know I cried my eyes out at the end lol.* 💕 ||| Emotional Damage: The Movie ||| Why have I not seen this film yet 🤦🏽‍♂️ ||| oh my god i was so little when i watched this bro ||| The ending made me cry badly.. ||| Third time I watched this movie, I loved it despite the fact I cried all 3 times ||| shoutout to my ap spanish teacher for playing this in class when I was in highschool ||| Eugenio Derbez is great!  He is also wonderful in ""CODA."" ||| brings me back ||| Heart warming movie 😭 ||| IMO his daughter look like Kristen Bell ||| She’s so pretty the little girl I love her eyes 🥺🥺🥺🥺💕💕 ||| 99865قصصضقغهحجكي ||| I just watched it...I'm 49 yeas old and ha a 7 year old daughter... I just can't stop crying ||| Everytime I watch it I cry awesome movie ||| I watched this in my Spanish class in 2014 and then again in 2016. Such a great movie! The ending had the entire class speechless both times. ||| Even if he wasn't the real father, he is still her father, it's like you put your baby to adoption, and god knows how many years later the biological mother comes and tries to take her away from the father. That's messed up. ||| Beautiful movie!!! ||| THE DOCTOR FROM MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN MOVIE ||| Sorry time to go sob now ||| Honestly she didn't raise thay child. Biologically it is her child but it really isn't at the same time. ||| This movie had no business being that sad. ||| Just finished watching it..... the whole time I thought he was going to die and then the twist took my breath away and my heart dropped 💔😰  im still crying 😭😭😭😭 ||| I'm gonna watch this on 2020 ||| Damn the ending.. is it me being stupid from the start or is that ending is a twist? ||| The ending was so unexpected WTF😭😭 ||| I did not see the movie just reading comments i m going to cry ||| Where can I watch this movie ||| This movie... I'm speachless. ❤ ||| I cry alot at the end of the movie...
But laughing alot too... ||| One of the best movie I have ever seen. And Eugenio is a very good actor, that girl is a revelation too👏🌟 ||| So cute ||| This was such a great movie. I cried so many times throughout the whole movie.  Definitely a tear jerker. Especially if you’re a parent. Eugenio Derbez was awesome in this movie. Him and the little girl had great father daughter chemistry. ||| :( ||| يخي  الو اللي تحلو الو الو حلو الو بالو ||| فلا 😘💟💗💌 爱情无比ورر衣服都会发挥风景3 ||| I used to watch this movie all the time with my dad when I was little. Also my dad is Mexican and I look white so the characters have similarities to us 😊 ||| just watched this movie and I cant understand how there's parents that left they children I'm a proud father of a 2 years old daughter and I want to be all the time with her !!! This is so far one of the best movies from Eugenio Derbez 👏🏻 ||| Bruh I watched this in Spanish class ||| Hey,anyone know the title of that song from 1:45...it's really familiar..just can't remember the title..😔..please help.. ||| Good one ||| Was she like sick or something at the end I was like wtf and how? ||| I cried like a baby at the end omg😭 ||| 2020? ||| Pretty much exactly like 
Domain Tout Commence ||| I literally cried *SIX TIMES* while I was watching the movie..I couldn’t stop crying at the end ||| I FINALLY FOUND IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS A FEVER DREAM ||| Just watched it so interesting nd sad,it made me cry ||| Why are you guys spoiling the movie in the comments ||| It would have been so much better if the mother was Kristen bell they look soo alike ||| Aint spanish, but watched this movie with no subtitles on. Still made me sob. 11/10. Masterpiece ||| I cried so bad omg :( ||| 10/10 !!!!! ||| I'd be a drain checker too. ||| 2:08 if you've already watched the film, those words of her saying she wants to live with him for the rest of her life hits me like bus 😭 ||| I hate when people spoils the movies..... ||| I love this movie. I cried so much at the end. ||| I love how this movie is based on love but not the romantic kind, the love between a parent and a child is a beautiful thing. ||| This movie! I cried so much at the end! ||| This shows the whole movie... ||| I haven't even watch the movie and from the comment spoiler section I am crying like anything ||| I keep reward  the end several times...and i cried for each... ||| Never trust blond female...until she prove that she's one of the rare exception. ||| Copy paster Bollywood Copy this movie too. ||| Gak ad otk ||| Instructions not included gave my baby to my Hispanic husband ||| Wish they had a English version.... I might watch it anyway lol ||| She looks like a little kristen bell :) ||| what was the cause of death? ||| wow Epic will watch for sure.....XD ||| This is the exact same as the French movie ||| The part a esa señora se la tapa muy seguido la coladera,verdad? 😂 ||| Spoiler alert.......the kid dies at the end. ||| I’m still crying like a baby 😭😭😭 ||| Love the Story ! but its going to be difficult to watch the film while reading the subtitles. they should remake it in English with the same cast. the trailer kinda gave away everything. but would still watch. ||| this is just a copy of another movie ||| The story seems very familiar. Is it possible they made this movie in a french version too? ||| I feel like I just watched the whole movie just by watching a 2 minute trailer.",0.0323331811663229,0.9910681843757628,2,1,0.02,100
